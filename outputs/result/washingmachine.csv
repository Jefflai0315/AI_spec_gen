I'm currently living in a place where the washing machine room is shared between all apartments.  
Since few days we figured out that a f\*\*\*\* crazy psycho is stealing some of our underwear when the machine is finished.

I currently have a Samsung Washmachine (model WD90J6A10AW), is there a general way to keep the door closed? Is there some system to lock it until we come back to take the clothes?  
If needed I will buy another one that could have this capability, my room mate is so afraid now that she is cleaning her clothes at her mom's place.

I was stupid and ran an unbalanced washing load with a heavy bath mat. It was banging around, and we forcibly shut down the washer and reset it. Now when running the washing machine, once it runs through all cycles, the washing machine keeps spinning as if it's stuck in the spin cycle. All indicating lights turn off at this point. We have tried to look at the error signal in the washing machine motor, but I think the light is dead since it doesn't even show the lights for standby or running, let alone error signals. When we put the washing machine into service mode to check the error codes, we found the Slow Pump and No Fill error codes. The washing machine pumps and fills at a what we believe is a normal rate. We can manually fill and pump out the water as well. We tried resetting the codes. At first, when we ran a test load, it shut off normally, but now when we ran another load, the machine continued to keep spinning when all the cycles finished out. We unplugged the washing machine to shut off the spinning, and no more error codes came up. I am not sure what is going on with the washer. Please help.",1580703349.0,[]

If the machine is older and not used to the high temperature, use one lower. You could also put some vinegar in it (about a cup). Make sure to put the vinegar in a plastic bowl or somethin, not just loose in the machine.

So, I thought simple fix, I bought a set of new belts and installed them. My washer machine started agitating and then just stopped working, like at all. No sound, no draining, nothing. So I was told that the fuse in my lid switch could've blown, so I bought a new lid switch assembly for the machine and again, started up fine, started to agitate, then instead of draining the machine didnt drain at all, but this time the timer kept going as though the machine was going through a normal cycle, but there was a burning smell coming from the machine and both the motor and timer were hot to the touch, so I left it for a while and then turned it on for just a couple of seconds to see if it would do anything, and it will drain and spin, but the machine seems to get hot almost instantly. Any advice on what's going on? Is the fuse to strong for the machine? Could the belt be too tight and be causing the motor to overheat? I need advice.

HELP! Washed cloths that were used with T-cut on the car in the washing machine and can't get rid of the smell!,1,cwmfl4,washingmachine,https://www.reddit.com/r/washingmachine/comments/cwmfl4/help_washed_cloths_that_were_used_with_tcut_on/,0,Has anyone ever washed polish and tcut cloths in their washing machine and ever found a way of getting rid of the smell from the machine? I can't and the Mrs isn't too impressed. Can't use the machine with it smelling like it as the clothes are smelling of it when it comes out. Any help would be great. Tried cleaning the machine with bicarbonate soda and white vinegar and run a hot wash too with nothing in it. Not working and now the kitchen sticks of tcut too 🙈,1567006516.0,[]
