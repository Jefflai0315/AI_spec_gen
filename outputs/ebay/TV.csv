No damage to the outside carton or to the TV.Physical unpacking and set up was easy. Complying with all the Samsung setup conditions was intrusive and offensive. It left a bad taste.

"TCL 43"" 4-SERIES 4K UHD HDR ROKU SMART TV 43S425 Television ", , ,"['So, assuming you’re already a TCL Roku tv owner, this has all the greatness of the previous models. It still has the electrical burning smell, which a lot of the types of TVs have. Not just this brand. There is just the one thing. When you hit the power button and turn it off, the screen does not fully turn off. There is a very low backlight that is always on. I read about this not being “an issue” but rather a complete annoyance. All I can really say is deal with it, buy a WiFi outlet (like I did) and turn it off/unplug it after use or simply buy a new one. The QLEDs are supposed to be a much larger jump in greatness. Overall I’m happy with it but I hope the board doesn’t overheat and burn out the board due to this light being on. And it is not the indicator LED. If you go to the Roku forums, there is a lengthy discussion about this issue. But it’s still a great value and pictures. I’ll probably never go to another brand. Just keep upgrading after a couple years. ', 'I’ve already purchased this TV a couple years back and had it for 2 years without any issues or picture quality loss. I sold the tv and that’s why I had bought a new one recently. But without a doubt great value! ', ""Make sure you protect your TV, bought 2 and broke one on my own error of trying to just balance it. Good product, works well though my crappy phone doesn't screen mirror as it says it could.. but good size and beautiful display and tons of Roku Channels. Lots of free content. "", 'Bought for a gift and my daughter and her kids love it. Alll they have to decide is who has control of the remote.', 'Very good picture quality easy set easy to use Easy on the wallet.', 'This tv has a great picture and good sound quality especially for an awesome price. You will not be disappointed if you make this purchase ', 'Easy to setup. Crisp picture. Fairly lightweight. Works well with Chromecast.
