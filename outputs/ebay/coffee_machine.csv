New DeLonghi All-In-One Combination Coffee|Espresso|Cappuccino Machine - #BCO430,240.0, ,"[""I have tried everything and read the manuel at least four times and this Espresso Maker just does not work right.  To start with no matter if you use ground coffee or grind it yourself it puts very little flavor in the cup.  Probably this is due to the fact that the water never gets truly hot.  It gets a little more than luke-warm but not by a lot and certainly not hot enough to brew coffee.  And it does not matter if you allow it to warm up for 15 minutes or 45 the water still doesn't warm up hot enough to brew coffee.  What  a disappointment.  I will never buy a DeLonghi 10 cup Coffee and Expresso Maker again.  Also I won't buy anything like this from EBAY again because if I had purchased elsewhere I could return it. "", ""I'm satisfied with my purchase, because it was a new open box item that i got for about $300 under msrp. So, for $129 or however much i paid, its well worth it and a heck of a value! Functionally it does Brew coffee very well, (just as good as the cuisinart it replaced), and the espresso makes espresso. Its got a 15 bar rating and i believe it, because nothing can get through those little tiny espresso filters without that sort of pressure. So far I've only used Starbuck Sumatra and Dunkin donuts coffees, but they taste as good as anything you'd buy from a coffee house. One big sidenote though, is i do have a Culligan system including reverse osmosis, so the water i use is along the lines of say Dasani bottled water. If you're trying to use crummy water to make coffee, your coffee will taste crummy no matter what sort of machine you own. It'll also scale up and but out faster and be much harder to clean. Use filtered, softened, reverse osmosis and you'll be happy from the shower to the coffee pot lol.So, it makes espresso and can steam froth milk, so you can make nice cappuccinos as well. The downside is, you've got to make sure that the switch on the left side turns on the heater for the espresso and steam. There's two lights on the front that turn green, one for the espresso and the other for the steam. It takes a while for those to turn green, letting you know the water is hot enough. Then after brewing it takes a bit for the heat to catch up again, so you can't make espresso quick fast and in a hurry like a barista.I've had to use coffee mugs and a small Pyrex measuring cup. The box shows two clear air insulated espresso cups and a stainless steel frothing container, but those don't come in the box.One last thing, is if you've never owned an espresso machine, or brewed legit espresso, you're in for a little learning curve and its more work than you might think. Its not like ordering one from Starbucks. At home, you've got to do all the messy tedious work yourself and then cleanup once you're done. If i had to guess, after a week of practice, it takes me about 10 minutes from start to finish to enjoy 2 minutes worth of cappuccino. Is it worth it? Yes i suppose so, because i don't have to drive anywhere to get it.All in all not a bad purchase if you can find one at a good deal like i did."", 'The only con for me, is the size of the groupo (the espresso filter cup). I like a large cup of espresso, and even the ""double"" is a very small serving (for my preferences). Everything else about this machine is a ""pro"". It\'s easy to use, easy to clean, brews an excellent pot of coffee, and has a great frother/steamer.I am quite happy with my purchase. Especially since I bought it used for $40.00 (!!) from someone that took very good care of it. It was received very clean and in near new condition.', 'The steaming spout is a little bit shorter than would like but other than that it works great', ""First it said you wouldn't have to move from under the cabinets not true, the drip coffee is ok but the espresso is awful it looks beautiful but not worth 200 hundred dollars I need you to send me a label so I can send it back thank you."", 'The machine looks and works great. The only issue I have is that when making coffee, steam escapes from where the water filter is and causes some condensation on the back of the machine.After making coffee and opening to clean used coffee grinds, water/condensation falls all over the counter. Possible design issue.', 'Very nice style. Easy to set up. Brews excellent coffee.Very good espresso. Steamer for Cappuccino is excellent. all around excellent machine.', 'Had many chips, damage and dirty…..very unhappy with this company….need a big discount on it….RWelch', ""It's not so easy to make cappuccino.But the coffee maker is great for brewing coffee."", 'Very happy with this purchase!! Was looking to switch from a french press after 5+ years. Both the drip coffee and the espresso side work great!']","New: A brand-new, unused, unopened, undamaged item in its original packaging (where packaging is applicable).

Black Espresso Cappuccino Latte 4 Cup Coffee Machine with Milk Frother Steamer,45.99,268 sold,"[""This espresso machine is perfect for everyday use. It takes up very little room on the worktop. It's ideal for 2x cups of espresso. It will make a mug of coffee. If I want latte I steam the milk first then the coffee itself takes about 30seconds. Then pour on the frothy milk, really smooth. When finished takes only minutes to clean, just a quick rinse and wipe"", 'Seems to be working fine, almost silent in operation, just a slight clicking when in mosquito mode. Would have scored 5 stars if the body could have been a little bit narrower, you have to switch on the socket before you plug in the repeller.', 'Very simple design. It needs practice to get volumes right and it is not automatic but it does what it says it does making perfect coffee. Frothing the milk also needs practice. But by buying ready ground coffee at £1 in Poundstretcher it works out at about 3p a cup.', 'I bought this as I have never liked filter coffee and this uses ground coffee. It arrived this morning, its very easy to use and makes just enough for the  large mug  I use for coffee. I used just over half a scoop of flavered ground coffee and was plesently surprised it was just as I like coffee. Not so strong to stand a spoon in as you get with filter coffee. Definitely worth the price.', 'Perfect coffee machine, I love its compact and classic style.

Breville BES870XL Barista Stainless Steel Espresso Coffee Machine with Grinder,699.95,96 sold,"[""I am loving this machine. We use it 3-4 times per day and it is pretty easy to learn. Definitely different beans require perfecting the technique all over again. The fresher the beans the more I have trouble getting the grind just right I think because there is more oil in the beans.  But it comes with dual wall baskets for the less masterful barista.  I love the grinder and I love that all of the features of the machine, grind, amount, temperature, shot pull time, etc are all adjustable so you can make the machine make your ideal cup just the way you like it.  This machine will pay for itself in a year or less as a result of decreasing visits to the coffee house.  It makes espresso on par with my favorite local coffee shop, and waaaayy better than Starbucks.  I have had no trouble with the machine and I've already made hundreds of shots with it."", ""I feel for the people who paid $600 for this machine.  The design of the water inlet seal is inexcusably poor-- as it ages, the rubber shrinks and puckers, leaving a scalloped surface around the nose of the tank, which does not seal well at all.  Failure to use a garter spring type seal in this critical spot is just plain dumb, or planned obsolescence.  The water inlet seal is on indefinite back-order from the only USA supplier, Breville will NOT sell parts to an end user, and wants $250 flat-rate for service.  The o-ring seals for steam connections also fail, but are readily available Silicone #007 size available all over the place.  If you are willing to modify the machine to use an external water supply, replace some leaky o-rings, it's an excellent performer.  Other thoughts:  The grind amount setting is never accurate because unless the bean hopper is full, beans fail to find their way into the sides of the grinder without manual stirring.  Not a big deal... The grinder can be operated momentarily by pushing in to turn on, in again to turn off.  After fixing the seals, adding an external tank, I have no trouble pulling excellent shots in the mid-high range on the pressure gauge, (a VERY helpful touch to get your grind/tamp settings right.)  Bottom line:  I LOVE it as a ~$240 DIY project, (Includes the price of a huge Brita tank, plumbing fittings, tubing + replacement O-rings,) would be ANGRY if I paid $300-$600 for it."", 'Great engineering and finish. Makes the very best coffee ever. Love the convenience of the built in grinder.

Instead of adding additional hot water, I add an extra ""single"" drip - that\'s a total of 5 cups  ( 2,2,1 buttons) for my single large coffee. Use the same loaded filter for all the drips.Then I heat and foam Almond non-sweetened milk , add a very small amount of organic Honey from a local farm. Wow!! Greatest cup of coffee - ever.Also - water is RO water that is frozen and defrosted  prior to adding to machine- that lowers the impurities from TDS 22ppm  from my RO water maker to TDS 12ppm! Thats twist as pure. Freezing water expels impurities from the ice crystals.Beans are Trader Joe\'s  French Roast Dark Roast Strong and Rich 26 oz package.I\'ve also ordered organic Columbian green beans and will roast in my home roaster to see difference in flavor.', ""I'm new to the espresso making so this is coming from a newbie. I think the machine coming with burr grinder is a great combo. I've used it now for probably 15-20 times or so and getting a hang of it. I think it's very simple and easy to use machine. Comes with everything you need to start making your own espresso, other than the beans, lol. I only tried Illy beans thus far, I'm more of a Americano guy and for that purpose this machine is perfect. My wife prefers latte/cappucino and that I think I still need to perfect, as the results for not been great. Part of the problem could be that she only wants decaf so that might have something to do with it as well. Steaming milk seems like a breeze, no issue with the process but I think getting the milk to the higher/better temperature is something to be desired here, but it could be my own inexperience with it, maybe I need some sort of thermometer. Speaking of temps, I like my coffee hot, so even using the hot water dispenser that's part of the machine still does not feel very hot to me. I tried to increase the temps using the Program function but so far I think I still would want it a bit hotter. Overall great purchase but I assume more expensive units could dial in the temps better. For my own use this is fine however."", 'All the features you would want in an espresso machine. Convenient integrated burr grinder that is adjustable for grind size and volume. Need a cup of hot water?...no problem. The machine can automatically dispense that exact volume as well. Easy to clean and maintain. The owners manual is well written and thoroughly covers all aspects of operations and the many features that are user selectable. You can spend a lot more and not get much better until you approach the mega dollar Italian models.', ""Best espresso this side of PARIS.  It does take some time to learn that you need to PACK the holder with a lot of force; then use the scraper in order to get mid-range pressure. And, use a bean with a lot of oils if you like real espresso.  Here's a recommendation. Peets Coffee, Major Dickason's Blend, Whole Bean (AMAZON)READ THE MANUAL.  Learn how the automatic grinder works; set level dial; push once to start and once to stop.  Set level so 1st fill does not overflow; tap, pack and repeat.  Slightly rotating packer helps.  Use TRIM tool or your risk no water; target 1/2 range on the pressure gage.  It takes heavy pressure to make this happen.  Grind setting 3 is best for me.PS.  Some Youtube videos show using the steamer without prep'ing it first; BAD idea.  Follow instructions and purge water from the steam cycle before you start frothing milk or you just add a lot of water to the froth!For Cafe American, just run your double expresso cycle twice (better than adding hot water and you get a perfect 50% dilution).  I drink this in the mornings; better on an empty stomach.  Real espresso should be for after a meal, IMO; just like FRANCE."", 'I’ve been making and drinking espresso from a wide variety of machines. Most of which have been made for high volume output in a cafe setting. This spoiled me and got me used to being able to pull shots and steam at the same time. That being said, the only downside to this machine is it’s inability to multitask. The manual is very detailed and could teach someone who has never laid and eye on an espresso machine how to make professional grade drinks. It also has great tips that even some experienced baristas could benefit from. The option to completely customize the whole experience is amazing. The hopper is air tight so you don’t have to worry about your beans going stale so quickly. The drain tray holds a very large amount of water before it warns you it needs to be emptied. I’ve learned you should turn the machine off before emptying the tray because of its auto purging feature though. It’s smaller than a toaster oven so it doesn’t take up too much counter space. Overall a great machine. ', ""I do not have a long history with a long list of espresso machines, and this is the first higher end machine I bought. It's not the easiest to use, a little daunting at first; you might think you need a cup of coffee to figure it out, but once you get it, it works well and simply, and you can tweak it to your own preferences in grind and volume. It makes great espresso and cappuccino."", 'As an avid espresso and a high-quality coffee addict , I was excited to see this espresso maker met all expectations and beyond. The coffee grinder is quite and does a great job grinding to various degrees of coarse-to- fine coffee. this immediately releases the aroma of the beans, making it ready to extract. the high extraction pressure allows for a creamy strong and robust espresso.The steamer is easy to use and clean, and does a great job.The programming feature is great, it allows you to define how hot you want your coffee, and how much is "" double shot"" Vs ""single shot"", and moreDownsides : not many or crucial issues. 1. the amount of coffee ground dispensed- the knob designated for this seems to be not as accurate as expected, despite dialing "" smaller amount"" it still gives you the same. this though can be overcome by manually stopping the grinding process as soon as the amount is satisfactory. 2. the tray, which is very well designed, gets filled faster than you may imagine, it announces "" Empty me"" relatively soon. but it is well designed and fun to clean and put together back again.Overall, I am very happy with this machine, it is beautiful, well designed, feels like high quality, and does an excellent job. highly recommended.', ""The machines requires some initial setup but after that you will have a perfect expresso every morning. In my opinion the Espresso is much better than the regular capsule machines like Nespresso etc. The other advantage is the price per cup, much less than the capsule machines. You just need to buy your coffee beans ( or make your own blend ) to create your perfect expresso.

I drink this in the mornings; better on an empty stomach.  Real espresso should be for after a meal, IMO; just like FRANCE."", 'I’ve been making and drinking espresso from a wide variety of machines. Most of which have been made for high volume output in a cafe setting. This spoiled me and got me used to being able to pull shots and steam at the same time. That being said, the only downside to this machine is it’s inability to multitask. The manual is very detailed and could teach someone who has never laid and eye on an espresso machine how to make professional grade drinks. It also has great tips that even some experienced baristas could benefit from. The option to completely customize the whole experience is amazing. The hopper is air tight so you don’t have to worry about your beans going stale so quickly. The drain tray holds a very large amount of water before it warns you it needs to be emptied. I’ve learned you should turn the machine off before emptying the tray because of its auto purging feature though. It’s smaller than a toaster oven so it doesn’t take up too much counter space. Overall a great machine. ', ""I do not have a long history with a long list of espresso machines, and this is the first higher end machine I bought. It's not the easiest to use, a little daunting at first; you might think you need a cup of coffee to figure it out, but once you get it, it works well and simply, and you can tweak it to your own preferences in grind and volume. It makes great espresso and cappuccino."", 'As an avid espresso and a high-quality coffee addict , I was excited to see this espresso maker met all expectations and beyond. The coffee grinder is quite and does a great job grinding to various degrees of coarse-to- fine coffee. this immediately releases the aroma of the beans, making it ready to extract. the high extraction pressure allows for a creamy strong and robust espresso.The steamer is easy to use and clean, and does a great job.The programming feature is great, it allows you to define how hot you want your coffee, and how much is "" double shot"" Vs ""single shot"", and moreDownsides : not many or crucial issues. 1. the amount of coffee ground dispensed- the knob designated for this seems to be not as accurate as expected, despite dialing "" smaller amount"" it still gives you the same. this though can be overcome by manually stopping the grinding process as soon as the amount is satisfactory. 2. the tray, which is very well designed, gets filled faster than you may imagine, it announces "" Empty me"" relatively soon. but it is well designed and fun to clean and put together back again.Overall, I am very happy with this machine, it is beautiful, well designed, feels like high quality, and does an excellent job. highly recommended.', ""The machines requires some initial setup but after that you will have a perfect expresso every morning. In my opinion the Espresso is much better than the regular capsule machines like Nespresso etc. The other advantage is the price per cup, much less than the capsule machines. You just need to buy your coffee beans ( or make your own blend ) to create your perfect expresso. This model has several details and ingenious features you just can't find in others models.""]","New: A brand-new, unused, unopened, undamaged item in its original packaging (where packaging is applicable).

NEW Breville The Oracle Coffee Espresso Machine Stainless Steel BES980BSS,2385.0,21 sold,"['It lets you be an amateur barista. Learning about different coffee bean types and how to get the best coffees. Has a grinder attached, two water tanks; one for the coffee and one for the steamer (that also self cleans once you’ve finished using it). Compact, doesn’t take up much bench top room and looks great. ', ""This is my second Oracle, 1 at home and now 1 at work.  Easy to use, makes a great coffee.  Consistency is good so I can assess bean taste rather than get caught up in the machine or other variables.  Like all good brews it comes down to creating personal taste.  It can need 'tuning' from default settings (which is easy), also some time to season and settle in.  Without reservation I highly recommended this machine."", 'Machine is easy to use and gets the perfect amount of coffee into the basket tamped and ready to go every time. It saves on spillage and waste and makes a great coffee. I love it!', ""Not yet producing coffee to the quality level of my Lelit combi (which also featured a built-in grinder at half the price of the Oracle) but I believe I will get there.Overall convenience and speed of the machine is great, however the machine only comes with a double-dose filter basket, and the auto grinder always fills this basket up with a double dose of coffee. Pressing the 1cup button runs 1 shot's worth of water through 2 shots' worth of grounds, which means the 1cup button always makes a ristretto.Apparently Breville are working on a special single-dose filter basket that works with the auto tamp. Only realistic workaround for now is to always use the 2cup button and just let 1 shot pour straight into the drip tray."", 'The slight wear and dings on this machine is minimal and barely noticeable. The machine works pertectly and produces a great cup of coffee.Item was shipped extremely quickly', 'Fantastic machine and exactly as described ... once the minor adjustments are figured out for various  coffee beans, the Breville will deliver perfect coffee every time. Simple to use and easy to clean. Cannot overstate value for money for this piece of equipment. Highly recommend for anyone for considering an espresso machine for home use ', ""This is the first review i've left for a product, and i'm leaving it because the other reviews really helped in our purchase decision of this expensive machine. First off, is it worth the retail price? Hard to say, but we saved 20% on the sale price, so this lessened the sting.The machine itself is exactly as advertised - go watch the videos. The real test is in the making. This machine is automated enough to take the pain out of making an excellent coffee, but manual enough that you feel like you're in control.Registering the product and receiving the White Glove Service is an absolute must-do - you learn so much.Overall, we're really happy with this big purchase and recommend the quality of this product to others."", 'This is my 3rd coffee machine. While it requires a little more effort in some ways than my old automatic machines its really easy and the dual boiler is a real time saver frothing milk automatically while I prepare the espresso shots. So much control re grind, length of shot and auto tamp works perfectly to make perfect espresso shots. Milk frother as good as a commercial machine. Overall highly recommend the machine if you are enthusiastic about making awesome coffee at home.', 'if you want the perfect coffee this is the machine , it does it all for you , any fine tuning of coffee strength is easy on the digital display , temp adjustment and froth on the milk is also an easy adjustment to set the machine exactly how you like your coffee , yes its quite expensive but does a beautiful job and looks great ,i was a bit skeptical when i first saw the machine but  after watching a video demo was impressed and thought it worth a closer look , bought it and love it , if you love your coffee this is the machine to make it ,it really is this good', 'Great machine, very easy to use and maintain.Makes great coffee and good frother.Easy to set up to your liking, the grind and milk temperature.Once you have set it up, great coffee every time.']",New,11,Electrical,Machine,,,Stainless Steel,BES980BSS,38 cm,,Breville,Espresso Machine,Breville,Whole Beans,45 cm,220 - 240 V,Breville The Oracle,"Cappuccino, Espresso",Timer,,AS PER MANUFACTURER SPECS,41 cm,1800 W,,,,,,,,,15 bar,20 Kg,2.5L,,,,,,Digital,,N/A,Silver,N/A,Compliant,250 g,,N/A,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Breville BES870XL Barista Stainless Steel Espresso Coffee Machine with Grinder,665.99,30-day returns,"[""I am loving this machine. We use it 3-4 times per day and it is pretty easy to learn. Definitely different beans require perfecting the technique all over again. The fresher the beans the more I have trouble getting the grind just right I think because there is more oil in the beans.  But it comes with dual wall baskets for the less masterful barista.  I love the grinder and I love that all of the features of the machine, grind, amount, temperature, shot pull time, etc are all adjustable so you can make the machine make your ideal cup just the way you like it.  This machine will pay for itself in a year or less as a result of decreasing visits to the coffee house.  It makes espresso on par with my favorite local coffee shop, and waaaayy better than Starbucks.  I have had no trouble with the machine and I've already made hundreds of shots with it."", ""I feel for the people who paid $600 for this machine.  The design of the water inlet seal is inexcusably poor-- as it ages, the rubber shrinks and puckers, leaving a scalloped surface around the nose of the tank, which does not seal well at all.  Failure to use a garter spring type seal in this critical spot is just plain dumb, or planned obsolescence.  The water inlet seal is on indefinite back-order from the only USA supplier, Breville will NOT sell parts to an end user, and wants $250 flat-rate for service.  The o-ring seals for steam connections also fail, but are readily available Silicone #007 size available all over the place.  If you are willing to modify the machine to use an external water supply, replace some leaky o-rings, it's an excellent performer.  Other thoughts:  The grind amount setting is never accurate because unless the bean hopper is full, beans fail to find their way into the sides of the grinder without manual stirring.  Not a big deal... The grinder can be operated momentarily by pushing in to turn on, in again to turn off.  After fixing the seals, adding an external tank, I have no trouble pulling excellent shots in the mid-high range on the pressure gauge, (a VERY helpful touch to get your grind/tamp settings right.)  Bottom line:  I LOVE it as a ~$240 DIY project, (Includes the price of a huge Brita tank, plumbing fittings, tubing + replacement O-rings,) would be ANGRY if I paid $300-$600 for it."", 'Great engineering and finish. Makes the very best coffee ever. Love the convenience of the built in grinder. I use ""fine grind"", ""max quantity"", hard compacting of grinds in filter, brew 2- cups and hit twice for the taste and quantity for my large coffee cup.Pressure gauge is in the range or 10:00 - 12:00. Instead of adding additional hot water, I add an extra ""single"" drip - that\'s a total of 5 cups  ( 2,2,1 buttons) for my single large coffee. Use the same loaded filter for all the drips.Then I heat and foam Almond non-sweetened milk , add a very small amount of organic Honey from a local farm. Wow!! Greatest cup of coffee - ever.Also - water is RO water that is frozen and defrosted  prior to adding to machine- that lowers the impurities from TDS 22ppm  from my RO water maker to TDS 12ppm! Thats twist as pure. Freezing water expels impurities from the ice crystals.Beans are Trader Joe\'s  French Roast Dark Roast Strong and Rich 26 oz package.I\'ve also ordered organic Columbian green beans and will roast in my home roaster to see difference in flavor.', ""I'm new to the espresso making so this is coming from a newbie. I think the machine coming with burr grinder is a great combo. I've used it now for probably 15-20 times or so and getting a hang of it. I think it's very simple and easy to use machine. Comes with everything you need to start making your own espresso, other than the beans, lol. I only tried Illy beans thus far, I'm more of a Americano guy and for that purpose this machine is perfect. My wife prefers latte/cappucino and that I think I still need to perfect, as the results for not been great. Part of the problem could be that she only wants decaf so that might have something to do with it as well. Steaming milk seems like a breeze, no issue with the process but I think getting the milk to the higher/better temperature is something to be desired here, but it could be my own inexperience with it, maybe I need some sort of thermometer. Speaking of temps, I like my coffee hot, so even using the hot water dispenser that's part of the machine still does not feel very hot to me. I tried to increase the temps using the Program function but so far I think I still would want it a bit hotter. Overall great purchase but I assume more expensive units could dial in the temps better. For my own use this is fine however."", 'All the features you would want in an espresso machine. Convenient integrated burr grinder that is adjustable for grind size and volume. Need a cup of hot water?...no problem. The machine can automatically dispense that exact volume as well. Easy to clean and maintain. The owners manual is well written and thoroughly covers all aspects of operations and the many features that are user selectable. You can spend a lot more and not get much better until you approach the mega dollar Italian models.', ""Best espresso this side of PARIS.  It does take some time to learn that you need to PACK the holder with a lot of force; then use the scraper in order to get mid-range pressure. And, use a bean with a lot of oils if you like real espresso.  Here's a recommendation. Peets Coffee, Major Dickason's Blend, Whole Bean (AMAZON)READ THE MANUAL.  Learn how the automatic grinder works; set level dial; push once to start and once to stop.  Set level so 1st fill does not overflow; tap, pack and repeat.  Slightly rotating packer helps.  Use TRIM tool or your risk no water; target 1/2 range on the pressure gage.  It takes heavy pressure to make this happen.  Grind setting 3 is best for me.PS.  Some Youtube videos show using the steamer without prep'ing it first; BAD idea.  Follow instructions and purge water from the steam cycle before you start frothing milk or you just add a lot of water to the froth!For Cafe American, just run your double expresso cycle twice (better than adding hot water and you get a perfect 50% dilution).  I drink this in the mornings; better on an empty stomach.  Real espresso should be for after a meal, IMO; just like FRANCE."", 'I’ve been making and drinking espresso from a wide variety of machines. Most of which have been made for high volume output in a cafe setting. This spoiled me and got me used to being able to pull shots and steam at the same time. That being said, the only downside to this machine is it’s inability to multitask. The manual is very detailed and could teach someone who has never laid and eye on an espresso machine how to make professional grade drinks. It also has great tips that even some experienced baristas could benefit from. The option to completely customize the whole experience is amazing. The hopper is air tight so you don’t have to worry about your beans going stale so quickly. The drain tray holds a very large amount of water before it warns you it needs to be emptied. I’ve learned you should turn the machine off before emptying the tray because of its auto purging feature though. It’s smaller than a toaster oven so it doesn’t take up too much counter space. Overall a great machine. ', ""I do not have a long history with a long list of espresso machines, and this is the first higher end machine I bought. It's not the easiest to use, a little daunting at first; you might think you need a cup of coffee to figure it out, but once you get it, it works well and simply, and you can tweak it to your own preferences in grind and volume. It makes great espresso and cappuccino."", 'As an avid espresso and a high-quality coffee addict , I was excited to see this espresso maker met all expectations and beyond. The coffee grinder is quite and does a great job grinding to various degrees of coarse-to- fine coffee. this immediately releases the aroma of the beans, making it ready to extract. the high extraction pressure allows for a creamy strong and robust espresso.The steamer is easy to use and clean, and does a great job.The programming feature is great, it allows you to define how hot you want your coffee, and how much is "" double shot"" Vs ""single shot"", and moreDownsides : not many or crucial issues. 1. the amount of coffee ground dispensed- the knob designated for this seems to be not as accurate as expected, despite dialing "" smaller amount"" it still gives you the same. this though can be overcome by manually stopping the grinding process as soon as the amount is satisfactory. 2. the tray, which is very well designed, gets filled faster than you may imagine, it announces "" Empty me"" relatively soon. but it is well designed and fun to clean and put together back again.Overall, I am very happy with this machine, it is beautiful, well designed, feels like high quality, and does an excellent job. highly recommended.', ""The machines requires some initial setup but after that you will have a perfect expresso every morning. In my opinion the Espresso is much better than the regular capsule machines like Nespresso etc. The other advantage is the price per cup, much less than the capsule machines. You just need to buy your coffee beans ( or make your own blend ) to create your perfect expresso. This model has several details and ingenious features you just can't find in others models.""]","New: A brand-new, unused, unopened, undamaged item in its original packaging (where packaging is applicable).

NEW Breville Red Barista Express Coffee Machine & Espresso Maker.,829.99,44 sold,"['For starters,it looks great (bought the red one). After reading the manual (helps!) the setting up of the machine is quite easy. Takes a few failed attempts, and good coffee beans to start getting reasonable expresso. Watch Youtube expresso videos and keep experimenting. Love my machine!!', 'This coffee maker is perfect, if your taste buds are not happy with the fully automatic machines. Here is your chance to become your own barista and tweak your machine and skills to perfection. You will soon be able to impress your family and friends by making them coffee better than any coffee shop. It is pretty easy to use and keep clean and it looks GREAT in any kitchen. If you need a little help, you can find many good videos on YouTube, that will show you all you need to know.Making the perfect cup is almost a science. Add your choosy taste buds to that and most barista shops have a problem. This machine could soon become a real money saver, as you will prefer your own coffee to the ones you usually buy in the shops.', 'Coffee is just as good, if not better than my local cafe. Easy to use, fully customisable for your personal tastes. Takes a bit of practice to get tamping/grind just right, but well worth it once you learn. Heats up quickly even after multiple coffees. Everyone comments on how lovely the red is, it’s a nice pop of colour.', 'This is the second Barista Express I have purchased, the first being for my beach house rental. When set up correctly - grind, volume etc the espresso dispesed by this machine is rich and smooth. The integrated volumetric grinder means very little mess and wastage. Grind adjustment is simple and easy, facilitating the perfect 30 second extraction. As a barista with my own cafe, I highly recommend!', ""Pretty good time saver all round. There are just 2 things I wish for:1.- A light or a better way to deliver the ground coffee in to the portafilter; like maybe a full size portafilter, so the coffee doesn't fall out all the time.2.- Hotter coffee, the hot water and pressurizer just don't get hot enough. So you can never make a hot coffee.Otherwise pretty good all round."", 'This machine is compact, lightweight. So easy to clean, easy to fill water and fill with beans.  I am an older women but find this machine very easy to use.  Would recommend this machine to beginners like me who were always afraid to get such a machine.  We love our morning coffee.  Best Buy ever.', 'An awesome all in one coffee machine from Breville... easy to use and clean.. and will make you that perfect barista coffee every time', 'Thought to be an entry level machine but turned out to be more than that. Trial and error the grinder only a few times had got me the near perfect crema. I would recommend this to any coffee lover who is looking for their first proper coffee machine.

NEW Breville The Barista Express Coffee Machine Maker (Black) (RRP $899.95),799.99,39 sold,"['Cafe style coffee at home for a very affordable price. This machine produces the best coffee and we love it.Setting up is fairly painless and we had our first coffee going in around 30 minutes ( had to read the quick start guide first).The machine is easy to clean and refilling the water tank is a breeze. Coffee grinder is conveniently positioned on the top of the unit for easy access to add your beans.Note - Buy a cheap bag of beans to learn with first. While the machine is basically automatic you need to have the grind size, dosage amount and tamping pressure set up for your brand of beans. Keep in mind different brands of beans will require different settings (especially grind size - course or finer).What I like - Easy operation, 1 touch grind and dose for the filter basket, 1 or 2 cup coffee shot.What don’t I like - Not much, the only thing that would be nice would be dual boilers. This would allow you to make your milk at the same time the coffee is poured but for nearly twice the price I couldn’t justify it at the moment.Like most things you have to way up the cost against the features and the Breville has more than enough features for the price and makes fantastic coffee.Very happy with this coffee machine.', ""Just bought this and it's a good sturdy machine, easy to use and has all features we want and need. No complaints so far"", 'My mum bought one, and we loved it so much both my brother and I each bought one for our homes! All agree that we don’t need to buy coffees anywhere ever again!Getting the right balance of grind size, amount and tamping takes a bit of work and finesse - but it is well worth getting right!Highly recommend looking up a YouTube channel called Seattle Coffee Gear for guides for some great tips both specifically for this machine but that can also be applied to any machine out there. (Eg bean selection, tamping, warming up the machine first etc)', 'I am extremely happy with the product. It was very easy to set-up and making a coffee on the machine is a breeze. It is also very easy to clean and heats up in a matter of seconds. The only negative thing about the product is the difficulty in removing the burr for cleaning purposes. Overall, I am very happy that I decided to purchase this coffee machine.', 'Really great home coffee machine! I love the colour, it has great functionality where you dial up multiple variables to make the perfect cup of coffee. ', 'This is our first barista machine, it’s easy to use and makes excellent coffee. The quality is great and takes up little room, also you can dispense hot water for cups of tea without having to use a separate hot water jug.I suspect having a dual boiler would improve the speed of heating up the milk, but the price difference was too big to matter.Real easy to keep clean, used everyday, over and over by three adults.', 'I read a lot of reviews before I bought this. I had a cheaper Breville machine before which had performed well. This is a game changer, getting much better coffee from the same beans.', 'The shipper was so quick in shipping the product. For the Machine itself, dont waste another dollar on another product this thing is phenomenal and is very professional. Once tinkering with the grind youll get a perfect coffee every single time. Better than coffee shops. Highly recommend', ""Takes all the guess work out of making a coffee.  Easy to use, doesn't take long at all to brew that perfect cuppa.

New Breville BES870XL Barista Stainless Steel Espresso Coffee Machine,642.98,Last item available,"[""I am loving this machine. We use it 3-4 times per day and it is pretty easy to learn. Definitely different beans require perfecting the technique all over again. The fresher the beans the more I have trouble getting the grind just right I think because there is more oil in the beans.  But it comes with dual wall baskets for the less masterful barista.  I love the grinder and I love that all of the features of the machine, grind, amount, temperature, shot pull time, etc are all adjustable so you can make the machine make your ideal cup just the way you like it.  This machine will pay for itself in a year or less as a result of decreasing visits to the coffee house.  It makes espresso on par with my favorite local coffee shop, and waaaayy better than Starbucks.  I have had no trouble with the machine and I've already made hundreds of shots with it."", ""I feel for the people who paid $600 for this machine.  The design of the water inlet seal is inexcusably poor-- as it ages, the rubber shrinks and puckers, leaving a scalloped surface around the nose of the tank, which does not seal well at all.  Failure to use a garter spring type seal in this critical spot is just plain dumb, or planned obsolescence.  The water inlet seal is on indefinite back-order from the only USA supplier, Breville will NOT sell parts to an end user, and wants $250 flat-rate for service.  The o-ring seals for steam connections also fail, but are readily available Silicone #007 size available all over the place.  If you are willing to modify the machine to use an external water supply, replace some leaky o-rings, it's an excellent performer.  Other thoughts:  The grind amount setting is never accurate because unless the bean hopper is full, beans fail to find their way into the sides of the grinder without manual stirring.  Not a big deal... The grinder can be operated momentarily by pushing in to turn on, in again to turn off.  After fixing the seals, adding an external tank, I have no trouble pulling excellent shots in the mid-high range on the pressure gauge, (a VERY helpful touch to get your grind/tamp settings right.)  Bottom line:  I LOVE it as a ~$240 DIY project, (Includes the price of a huge Brita tank, plumbing fittings, tubing + replacement O-rings,) would be ANGRY if I paid $300-$600 for it."", 'Great engineering and finish. Makes the very best coffee ever. Love the convenience of the built in grinder. I use ""fine grind"", ""max quantity"", hard compacting of grinds in filter, brew 2- cups and hit twice for the taste and quantity for my large coffee cup.Pressure gauge is in the range or 10:00 - 12:00. Instead of adding additional hot water, I add an extra ""single"" drip - that\'s a total of 5 cups  ( 2,2,1 buttons) for my single large coffee. Use the same loaded filter for all the drips.Then I heat and foam Almond non-sweetened milk , add a very small amount of organic Honey from a local farm. Wow!! Greatest cup of coffee - ever.Also - water is RO water that is frozen and defrosted  prior to adding to machine- that lowers the impurities from TDS 22ppm  from my RO water maker to TDS 12ppm! Thats twist as pure. Freezing water expels impurities from the ice crystals.Beans are Trader Joe\'s  French Roast Dark Roast Strong and Rich 26 oz package.I\'ve also ordered organic Columbian green beans and will roast in my home roaster to see difference in flavor.', ""I'm new to the espresso making so this is coming from a newbie. I think the machine coming with burr grinder is a great combo. I've used it now for probably 15-20 times or so and getting a hang of it. I think it's very simple and easy to use machine. Comes with everything you need to start making your own espresso, other than the beans, lol. I only tried Illy beans thus far, I'm more of a Americano guy and for that purpose this machine is perfect. My wife prefers latte/cappucino and that I think I still need to perfect, as the results for not been great. Part of the problem could be that she only wants decaf so that might have something to do with it as well. Steaming milk seems like a breeze, no issue with the process but I think getting the milk to the higher/better temperature is something to be desired here, but it could be my own inexperience with it, maybe I need some sort of thermometer. Speaking of temps, I like my coffee hot, so even using the hot water dispenser that's part of the machine still does not feel very hot to me. I tried to increase the temps using the Program function but so far I think I still would want it a bit hotter. Overall great purchase but I assume more expensive units could dial in the temps better. For my own use this is fine however."", 'All the features you would want in an espresso machine. Convenient integrated burr grinder that is adjustable for grind size and volume. Need a cup of hot water?...no problem. The machine can automatically dispense that exact volume as well. Easy to clean and maintain. The owners manual is well written and thoroughly covers all aspects of operations and the many features that are user selectable. You can spend a lot more and not get much better until you approach the mega dollar Italian models.', ""Best espresso this side of PARIS.  It does take some time to learn that you need to PACK the holder with a lot of force; then use the scraper in order to get mid-range pressure. And, use a bean with a lot of oils if you like real espresso.  Here's a recommendation. Peets Coffee, Major Dickason's Blend, Whole Bean (AMAZON)READ THE MANUAL.  Learn how the automatic grinder works; set level dial; push once to start and once to stop.  Set level so 1st fill does not overflow; tap, pack and repeat.  Slightly rotating packer helps.  Use TRIM tool or your risk no water; target 1/2 range on the pressure gage.  It takes heavy pressure to make this happen.  Grind setting 3 is best for me.PS.  Some Youtube videos show using the steamer without prep'ing it first; BAD idea.  Follow instructions and purge water from the steam cycle before you start frothing milk or you just add a lot of water to the froth!For Cafe American, just run your double expresso cycle twice (better than adding hot water and you get a perfect 50% dilution).  I drink this in the mornings; better on an empty stomach.  Real espresso should be for after a meal, IMO; just like FRANCE."", 'I’ve been making and drinking espresso from a wide variety of machines. Most of which have been made for high volume output in a cafe setting. This spoiled me and got me used to being able to pull shots and steam at the same time. That being said, the only downside to this machine is it’s inability to multitask. The manual is very detailed and could teach someone who has never laid and eye on an espresso machine how to make professional grade drinks. It also has great tips that even some experienced baristas could benefit from. The option to completely customize the whole experience is amazing. The hopper is air tight so you don’t have to worry about your beans going stale so quickly. The drain tray holds a very large amount of water before it warns you it needs to be emptied. I’ve learned you should turn the machine off before emptying the tray because of its auto purging feature though. It’s smaller than a toaster oven so it doesn’t take up too much counter space. Overall a great machine. ', ""I do not have a long history with a long list of espresso machines, and this is the first higher end machine I bought. It's not the easiest to use, a little daunting at first; you might think you need a cup of coffee to figure it out, but once you get it, it works well and simply, and you can tweak it to your own preferences in grind and volume. It makes great espresso and cappuccino."", 'As an avid espresso and a high-quality coffee addict , I was excited to see this espresso maker met all expectations and beyond. The coffee grinder is quite and does a great job grinding to various degrees of coarse-to- fine coffee. this immediately releases the aroma of the beans, making it ready to extract. the high extraction pressure allows for a creamy strong and robust espresso.The steamer is easy to use and clean, and does a great job.The programming feature is great, it allows you to define how hot you want your coffee, and how much is "" double shot"" Vs ""single shot"", and moreDownsides : not many or crucial issues. 1. the amount of coffee ground dispensed- the knob designated for this seems to be not as accurate as expected, despite dialing "" smaller amount"" it still gives you the same. this though can be overcome by manually stopping the grinding process as soon as the amount is satisfactory. 2. the tray, which is very well designed, gets filled faster than you may imagine, it announces "" Empty me"" relatively soon. but it is well designed and fun to clean and put together back again.Overall, I am very happy with this machine, it is beautiful, well designed, feels like high quality, and does an excellent job. highly recommended.', ""The machines requires some initial setup but after that you will have a perfect expresso every morning. In my opinion the Espresso is much better than the regular capsule machines like Nespresso etc. The other advantage is the price per cup, much less than the capsule machines. You just need to buy your coffee beans ( or make your own blend ) to create your perfect expresso. This model has several details and ingenious features you just can't find in others models.""]","New: A brand-new, unused, unopened, undamaged item in its original packaging (where packaging is applicable).

Espresso Cappuccino Latte Coffee Maker Home Office Machine Expresso Cappacino,133.7,71 sold,"['I am very impressed with the quality of coffee that this machine can produce.  Although it\'s not a professional quality machine by any means, it is perfect for most home baristas that simply want to cut out some trips to the local coffee shop.  At first I thought I got a defective machine, because I am a man, and we never read directions.  I somehow convinced myself that you had to select with the knob on the side either steam or brew, then hit the button on the front.  After watching a review video online I figured out my mistake, and corrected to push the button on the front first, then wait for the ready light to come on (5-10 seconds).As far as brewing, the unit does a nice strong single shot, and a slightly weaker double shot, due to it\'s inability to hold as much coffee as the more professional machines.  Brewing is fast and user controlled by the knob on the side.  You can brew as little or as much as you like per fill.  The 12 BAR pump does nicely here.  The on board tank holds plenty of water to make several beverages.The steamer works well, and is able to create a pretty decent foam.  Frothing milk is not easy, so don\'t be discouraged if you have some issues at first.  I quickly removed the little rubber section and stick with the all metal part.  After you finish steaming and turn the knob back to center, it will purge the unit twice into the drip tray to remove pressure.  You can empty the tray easily after use.Cleaning is not a real issue, but the steam wand takes some work.  Some people steam into water and then wipe, others just scrub it off with a hot towel, etc.. The coffee basket and filter aren\'t that bad either, but be careful not to tilt the bowl much upon removal or you will spill the grounds on the drip pan.  A wipe down of the inner area where the water comes from to brew will need a wipe as well, a damp paper towel works well.  Use only the larger filter, the small one is worthless.  I don\'t see any reason it\'s even included.You CAN pack the coffee in, just don\'t over do it.  Coffee shops put about 30 pounds of force on the coffee to create a ""puck."" and monitor the grind to get the right flavor.  Some have complained that this unit won\'t handle finer grinds or compressing the puck, but I have done both with no issue.  I put about 5-6 pounds of pressure on the puck and fill it to the top of the bowl.  Use only espresso grind or grind your own to a finer consistency.  Using regular drip coffee will not result in anything worth drinking!I was so pleased with my unit I bought a 2nd and put it on the shelf just in case I ever have a problem with it.  My morning coffee is VERY important!', ""Basically an automatic machine that allows you to select pre programmed shots for Espresso, Cappuccino and latte; if not enough coffee is dispensed for the size of the cup being used you just hold down the Espresso, cappuccino or latte button until the cup has reached the desired amount you want in the cup. The fact that the separate mild container is removeable is a nice touch as you can refrigerate what is left in the milk reservoir.On the negative side, there is no easy means of cleaning the frothing tube. While the metal sleeve is easily removed with a twist and a pull, the actual spout is not removable, and therefore the whole milk reservoir needs to be washed every other time it is used for frothing; not an easy task as the walls of the milk reservoir are rounded.Having said all that, for the price point, this unit cannot be beaten and I have seen several fully automatic machines costing over $1000 that do NOT produce the quality results that this little unit does! If you don't want to deal with the learning process of using a traditional cappuccino machine and learning how to froth by trial and error, this is the best way to go, and if you are thinking of making cappuccino &amp; lattes for the first time, this will make the whole process easier!"", ""Even though it advertises at 15 bar pump system, I don't think it does. I had a Krups prior to this one (didn't want to pay lots of money) and was for sure superior that the Mr Coffee.  When brewing an expresso and remove the handle with the grounds, coffee ground are still soak and wet with water, so I don't think the pressure is enough. The krups, the grounds were almost dry after the brewing, showing a superior pressure. it is also very noisy machine. The wand for milk froth is almost useless.  Does not put out enough steam. "", ""Makes wonderful cappuccino. Haven't tried the expresso yet but if I need an extra coffee boost then I will. The machine is very easy to use. I always thought that this type of machine would be complicated but it's not. I think about all the money I have spent on cappuccino's over the years and could just kick myself. I am very happy with this purchase and it will pay for itself in no time believe me. If you like cappuccino as well as I do then grab this little baby. I doesn't take up a lot of space either."", 'This Mr. Coffee pump Espresso maker is Great for the budget and makes a Wonderful cup of espresso. I have had this same machine for years. The only reason I replaced it was the rubber gasket seal does wear out after years of use. To find that gasket is difficult. So, every 5 years or so I purchase a shiny new machine--same one! It is easy to use, clean and brews quickly. ', 'I like it, have tried a lot of other machines.  The price makes it worth it. When it gets a few months use, it breaks anyway, there is a design thing we’re it leaks water when making a cup. It happens early on if you use too soft coffee etc. it seems all 5 were the  same. As soon as I over tamp fine coffee it causes them to leak inside, but they still work.  I used a  pan under the machine to catch the water.. because of this leaking which is Constant.. internal .  I already trashed it or I’d show you. It’s been thrown away..', 'It makes an excellent double espresso.  It is able to brew reasonably well and quickly with the large, double espresso coffee ground holder -- unlike my former Delongi espresso maker which would stall-out if the grounds were too fine or the holder too full.  I have used my Mr. Coffee espresso maker consistently every morning the past year and am pleased thus far.I chose this espresso maker on the basis of careful review of hundreds of positive customer comments.  The only complaint is that the water reservoir leaks and floods the counter if left full for any length of time.  Could be a problem with the ""()"" ring seal.  I keep the Mr. Coffee in a high-sided tray to catch the water leakage.It is important that any new user read the manufacturer\'s instructions for proper and satisfactory operation.   ', ""I have had 2 steam machines and finally decided to upgrade to this 15 bar pump system. What a dream. Now I make cappuccino's like the pro's!!!!! This machine is small yet has a big reservoir, easy to use and is very quick and safe. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a nice espresso machine!! "", ""I really enjoy this expresso maker because in has enough bars of pressure for frothing and steam for the coffee grounds.  The price is perfect--I'm not spending 500 plus for a really good expresso maker!!!!  The company continues to update the maker to compete with other makers on the market, so I am really pleased!!  Delicious expresso."", 'All the ECMP50 have a problem, they have a leak. I bought 4 during the last 5 years, it makes an awesome cooffe but the leak is annoying. So if you put on a tray, you can use it without a mess on your counter top but check another options because there is no solution, the 4 I owned had the same problem, and not after a while, just weeks after I bought them. So, you know, a great espresso (like the professionals $1,500) but a lake around it.']","New: A brand-new, unused, unopened, undamaged item in its original packaging (where packaging is applicable).

Breville Barista Touch BES880BSS Espresso Machine - Silver, ,15 watchers,"['My 8 and 14 year old girls make Cafe quality lattes in minutes. Love this machine. It is my first expresso maker. I was concerned that it would be difficult to use but after watching how to videos it was easy. It gets hot in seconds and makes what you want how you want fast and easy. Have not touched my Kureg coffee maker since. Been experimenting with almond milk and liquid creamers and it will froth them decently. You can do a lot with this. It is heavy and seems well built. In my household it will pay for itself in roughly a year but should last much much longer. A great buy for a coffee enthusiast.', 'My Delongi finally died after 3 years. I wanted to upgrade to a better machine so I decided to splurge on a Breville Barista Touch. I have no regrets at all. It heats up quickly and makes a great cup of espresso and froth. The attached bur grinder is a plus because I have limited countertop space. The touchscreen is easy to navigate. It features the most popular drinks Espresso, Latte, Americano, Flat White, and Cappuccino. You can easily customize and save your own drinks. I recommend getting fresh whole bean and experiment with the grind setting for the best cup.', 'The ONLY thing negative about this Barista/expresso machine is that it does not get as hot as my husband would like...only reaches 170 degrees.  I am enjoying and LOVE it!  It is very easy to work, as well as clean!  I recommend:)', ""The product is doing everything it suppose to do. Only thing I couldn't get appropriate for me is the brewing temperature is on a low side even on the maximum settings(highest number is 4). Maybe it's only me because I use to Breville Barista(model 870)."", 'Love this machine. Had to try different settings and coffees and experiment a bit to get all of my types of cappuccinos and lattes just right. But this machine is the way to go! Fast shipping!', 'I am so thrilled with this purchase, and so in love with this product! Breville machines are definitely trial and era to figure out exactly how you like your beverages, and making them effectively, but it’s been great. I’m a visual person and couldn’t be happier to just look at it on my counter. This is an absolute score! Thank you!! 🙌🏾💖🥂😆', ""really nice well made machine. still haven't gotten a really good coffee out of it.  shots are either sour or bitter.  Easy to clean.  wife is not happy that its not fully automatic"", 'Upgraded from a cheap machine after it broke and wish I would have done it sooner. This makes delicious espresso, not sure what my older machine was making! Easy to use, love the touch screen.', 'Aside from still trying to master the microfoam and getting the perfect grind for my taste...

The machine display prompts when more coffee or water are required and also for cleaning actions. Cleaning steps are minimal when only making coffee or expresso. Using milk requires more cleaning, but this is expected and valued to ensure a clean and fresh cup every time. The LCD display is helpful and well designed. The instruction manual good stand a bit of improvement for clarity; e.g. to explain when to rinse vs. clean and to explain the internal workings of the machine cleaning cycle as well as more detailed power usage specs. I had to call customer support to get some questions answered, just for my own curiosity. But, this in no way detracts from the performance of the machine which is excellent. This machine has replaced my drip coffee maker, but I still keep a Keurig unit handy for times when I want to serve decaf coffee or a flavored coffee.', ""Not impressed and returned it.Pros:-- brewed quickly, -foams milk (but mine didn't because it was used and had a milk clog) ($150 to fix)-lots of drink options (cappuccino, espresso, latte etc.-grinder with about 5 levels of grindCons:-does NOT take Starbucks dark roast beans (they are oily and will clog the grinder) -expensive to service when it breaks and good luck finding someone, apparently only easy to buy one-only takes light to medium roast of beans....what's the point if I cant choose my darks....-only uses beans and not ground coffee.

There are just 2 things I wish for:1.- A light or a better way to deliver the ground coffee in to the portafilter; like maybe a full size portafilter, so the coffee doesn't fall out all the time.2.- Hotter coffee, the hot water and pressurizer just don't get hot enough. So you can never make a hot coffee.Otherwise pretty good all round."", 'This machine is compact, lightweight. So easy to clean, easy to fill water and fill with beans.

Attractive, uncomplicated to use, makes a great cup of espresso, no matter which flavor.  ', 'Awesome product. But don\'t use the cheap after market capsules. They taste weak and not match up with original line. If the milk frother is clogged, use a smaller tweezer to remove the tension spring and ball inside, clean it and you are set to go.

Breville BES880BSS1BUS1 The Barista Touch Espresso Machine - Brand New,899.0, ,"['My 8 and 14 year old girls make Cafe quality lattes in minutes. Love this machine. It is my first expresso maker. I was concerned that it would be difficult to use but after watching how to videos it was easy. It gets hot in seconds and makes what you want how you want fast and easy. Have not touched my Kureg coffee maker since. Been experimenting with almond milk and liquid creamers and it will froth them decently. You can do a lot with this. It is heavy and seems well built. In my household it will pay for itself in roughly a year but should last much much longer. A great buy for a coffee enthusiast.', 'My Delongi finally died after 3 years. I wanted to upgrade to a better machine so I decided to splurge on a Breville Barista Touch. I have no regrets at all. It heats up quickly and makes a great cup of espresso and froth. The attached bur grinder is a plus because I have limited countertop space. The touchscreen is easy to navigate. It features the most popular drinks Espresso, Latte, Americano, Flat White, and Cappuccino. You can easily customize and save your own drinks. I recommend getting fresh whole bean and experiment with the grind setting for the best cup.', 'The ONLY thing negative about this Barista/expresso machine is that it does not get as hot as my husband would like...only reaches 170 degrees.  I am enjoying and LOVE it!  It is very easy to work, as well as clean!  I recommend:)', ""The product is doing everything it suppose to do. Only thing I couldn't get appropriate for me is the brewing temperature is on a low side even on the maximum settings(highest number is 4). Maybe it's only me because I use to Breville Barista(model 870)."", 'Love this machine. Had to try different settings and coffees and experiment a bit to get all of my types of cappuccinos and lattes just right. But this machine is the way to go! Fast shipping!', 'I am so thrilled with this purchase, and so in love with this product! Breville machines are definitely trial and era to figure out exactly how you like your beverages, and making them effectively, but it’s been great. I’m a visual person and couldn’t be happier to just look at it on my counter. This is an absolute score! Thank you!! 🙌🏾💖🥂😆', ""really nice well made machine. still haven't gotten a really good coffee out of it.  shots are either sour or bitter.  Easy to clean.  wife is not happy that its not fully automatic"", 'Upgraded from a cheap machine after it broke and wish I would have done it sooner.

"Breville Nespresso Creatista Plus Coffee Espresso Machine, 1, Stainless Steel",539.95,14 watchers,"['It was easy to set up, very easy to use, heats super fast and a great cup of coffee or any of the espresso types.  Works great.  Pricey but probably worth it.', 'I have become spoiled by this machine.  The pods are easy to use and fully recyclable.  The variations of use as well as product availability is great!  This machine is easy to use, it does take a little time to clean, but fairly easy to do.  The steamer wand heats and froths the milk at the same time.  This little machine has made it easy for me to enjoy my favorite coffees at home!', ""So far loving it. Adjustable milk froth and temperature sets this machine apart from other models.  It brews quick an, easy and hot. The pods give good crema and the milk froth comes out perfect for latte art. Under the dispenser, there is enough room to fit everything from my single shot espresso cup to my double walled latte glass. Clean up is easy, steam purge is awesome. The overall construction is very sturdy, lots of stainless metal parts.  The machine is heavy and sits well on the counter.  Water reservoir holds a good amount and is easy to refill.  Obviously Nespresso cant be compared to a true espresso maker. I just don't have the patience and time in the morning to fiddle with grinding, measuring, packing and extracting the perfect shot, then froth milk and clean up.  So, this Creatista Plus is a lifesaver and makes a pretty good tasting, consistent cup in a whim."", 'The lattes from this machine are better than those from many of the boutique coffee shops in Seattle, IMHO. My only criticism is that virtually all Nespresso machines output lukewarm coffee or espresso shots, but at least it won’t ever scald you, and it does taste excellent with perfect cream and pleasant taste. We are very happy with this machine after 2 weeks! Steamed dairy milks and nut mills turn out perfectly, with excellent texture and no thinking/guesswork. Is this machine going to win Iron Chef Barista? Probably not, but it’s more than good enough for the average coffee aficionado, and better than many barista shops you’ve been to.', 'This is my first purchase on Ebay and to be honest, I was a bit hesitant because I didnt know what to expect or if I would be duped. However, the machine was GREAT!!!! works perfectly! I had one already and i just wanted to get another. Would buy off these guys again. Bonus: it arrived to me 4 days earlier than the approximate.', ""I've been using a Nespresso Pixie (actually have owned two) for years, so imagine my delight when I found that Breville makes a machine that using the Nespresso capsules that is beautiful as well as amazingly functional.

NEW BREVILLE  Oracle Touch Coffee Espresso Machine Stainless Steel BES990BSS,2499.99, ,"[""The Oracle Touch is exactly what I was looking for:  Italian barista quality espresso and espresso/milk drinks but with the relative ease of use of a super automatic.  I love that the grinder is adjustable and that it automatically tamps into a real 22g portafilter.  Moving the portafilter over from the grinder side to the brewing side is the most complicated part of using it, and if you can't do that, this machine isn't for you.The auto milk foaming with different settings for flat whites vs. cafe lattes vs cappuccinos and the ability to adjust the final temperature of the milk works great.  Being able to add my own custom espresso drinks to the touchscreen menu is great, and I really like the auto-on feature so it's warmed up before I head down to use it first thing in the morning.Watching the espresso drip out for up to 30 seconds during the brewing process will let you know that you're getting the right extraction.  Seeing the crema and then tasting the results are what really counts.  And assuming you start with good, fresh, well-roasted espresso beans (not Starburnt), you'll get the right results.  Love it!"", 'Excellent coffee maker, cappuccino machine, expresso, grinder, all of it!!Had it a month or so and only complaints:The coffee cup space is smallDon\'t let the grounds set too long or they are hard to remove after brewing. The machine overall works excellent, and it makes better coffee than I buy elsewhere. Very easy to use for my wife who is not ""techy."" Highly recomend.', 'After a short learning curve we love the all of the coffee drinks.  If you are a regular Starbucks shopper it will pay for itself in a year or two.  We were very pleasantly surprised at how well it foamed nut-based milks.  And the automatic self-cleaning feature of the steam arm is great.  Highly recommended.', 'High quality machine with fantastic features!  Perfect for 8oz cups, but not larger higher profile cups, so making double Americana for larger mugs requires a two step process.', 'The Oracle touch is amazing, easy to use, sleek looking. It makes better coffee than I can buy anywhere else! My absolute favorite piece of equipment in the kitchen. Perfect for my morning latte, my afternoon cappuccino with my friend or serving several guests or clients at once. ', 'Excellent easy to use espresso machine. Easy to dial in and get a good espresso shot. Automated milk for thing is extremely convenient. Both espresso and frothing can be done manually or by letting the machine handle it for you. ', 'Great product and very easy for both my wife and I to use. Spent hours researching these expresso makers before finally selecting this one.

Saves time too. Can brew and froth milk at the same time. ', 'Came New in the box, arrived well packed with great tracking.

Nespresso Vertuo Coffee and Espresso Maker Breville Aeroccino3 BNV250CRO1BUC1,210.0, ,"['I like to try different varieties of coffee without the expense of ordering from a coffee house.  I was able to get a great price on a new machine (Older model) and then went to the Nespresso site to set up an account.  The coffee capsules for this machine look like balls that have been cut in half and are made from aluminum.  The standard (original) Nespresso pod, which looks like a similar design seen for K-cup brewing machines, will not work with the Vertuo machines. Be aware of these two designs when shopping for coffee on such sites as eBay.  The capsules themselves, run from 0.80 cents per pod (espresso shots) to around $1.20 (14 ounce brewed cup).  Espressos are like a shot of whiskey...not much there but I still like them despite the price.  For the most part, I stick to the capsules that are 7 ounces are higher so I fell like I am getting my monies worth.  I have only had the machine itself less than a month so I can not attest to longevity.  I did, however, purchase a two-year warranty when I made my initial purchase.', 'Product received looking very nice and like new.  very clean.  Problem is this product does not brew.  Not sure if pump is broke or what, but does not work', 'The Coffee has the best taste coffee brew I have ever tasted!', 'So easy to use! I loved it from the first time I used it. So glad I finally bought one!', 'I love it!  Because it’s Swiss and the caffe taste great. The milk frothed is absolutely amazing! ', 'Can’t go wrong with this machine!   Makes the best cup with a little foam each time.  Will never use anything else!', 'This machine is awesome! It brews different sizes, quick and easy. I love it. ', 'Very easy to use. Looks nice. Makes a very good brewed cup of coffee.', 'We drink it as a treat. A different way of enjoying a cup of coffee. Like the foam part ...add caramel to it.

Nespresso Citiz Coffee and Espresso Machine by DeLonghi with Aeroccino Black,454.27,30-day returns,"['The best feature of the Citiz machines is the MANUAL piercing lever. It\'s easy to use, doesn\'t eat electricity and isn\'t prone to breakdown as is so often the case in ""totally"" automated machines where the piston jams or dies, resulting in the end of the entire machine. 2 things I don\'t like is 1) The Milk-Frother is attached. The obvious advantage is not requiring a separate outlet however if it fails, it affects the entire unit and vice-versa.  2) It doesn\'t have an ON/OFF switch and instead employs the use of the Brew buttons, which will result in them wearing out sooner instead of later.', 'This machine uses Nespresso compatible pods which are cheap, cheap, cheap. The frothier allows you to make lattes, cappuccinos and I love the espressos! Finish each day with a coffee tonic which I could never make before!', 'So easy to use and makes an excellent espresso. Love how fast it is and how perfect the foam is. I’ve even used almond milk in it and it comes out perfectly.', 'I love my machine and love the fact that I can use Lavazza capsules ', 'This is the real deal. Espresso like you would enjoy in a good Italian cafe. We’re still experimenting with the flavors but Levanto seems to be the front runner. The machine itself is compact and looks sharp. Heats up very quickly and brews even faster. The frothier heats and whips our milk or creamer into a little cloud of deliciousness. Makes a shot of expresso or a “lungo” which is basically twice the size of a shot but milder. And something important to me - biodegradable cups! It’s a steal compared to some of the machines we looked at but definitely not bargain coffee. Highly recommend.', 'This is by far the awesomest product I’ve ever purchased. I have not enjoyed coffee this much in years. It brews great tasting espresso very quickly. I’ve ordered several styles of coffee and am having a great time tasting them.', 'Very easy to use and brews espresso superbly. I love the sleek and user-friendly design. My only minor complaint is that I wish that the milk frother can be placed on the left side rather than the right side.', 'But we are under the impression this may not be the newest version. There seems to be a new style with different bigger coffee capsules', 'This machine is solid in its construction, able to withstand some pretty heavy use. Brews quickly as well.', 'I feel so special every time I use my Nespresso, it has saved me so much money at Starbucks and I’m not missing one thing .']","New: A brand-new, unused, unopened, undamaged item in its original packaging (where packaging is applicable).

"Breville BES870BSXL The Barista Express Coffee Machine, Black",,5 watchers,"['Awesome machine. You can grind your own coffee and also prepare espressos, americanos and capuccinos. I dont know if I got a deffective machine or maybe I am not an expert on handling it but I had one single issue with it. When I started grinding my own coffee, I could not find a setting fine enough that the machine could actually work under pressure and I would not achieve an espresso pressure setting. I had to calibrate the grinder inside the machine which is not normal coming straight from the manufacturer. I finally with that calibration was able to achieve pressures high enough to reach to the gray zone. I have contacted them and they sent me some troubleshooting tips which I am still trying. Meanwhile I am still enjoying it. ', ""I make a great espresso with this machine. It's pricey, however I get consistent brews once properly dialled in. You want high quality,  well this does it. Only super gripe I have, the new style bean hopper up top is a pain in the behind to try and fit under cupboards! Breville!?! Do you measure cabinetry in North America?"", 'This really does live up to its reputation. It’s easy to use, easy to clean, it just takes some frequent adjusting to accommodate the grind for the weather, temp, humidity etc. No problem! We love it! I’m sure I made up the cost in the first several months!', 'I love my coffee anytime of day and while it takes few minutes to do an entire course (grind, brew, heat/foam) it’s perfect!!!! Plug in and use. So so user friendly', 'Great machine if you want to learn how to pull shots and make good espresso. If you want the easy way out, go to Starbucks and drink coffee flavored water. #ignoranceisbliss', 'makes a good consistent cup of espresso and is easy to use. My only gripe is that the stainless steel portafilter basket (the metal coffee ground holder) sticks to the group head on the machine and does not remain in its portafilter handle, making it necessary to ""dig"" the portafilter off of the machine every time you brew an espresso.  The handle should have been designed with a tighter friction lock on the portafilter basket so it won\'t separate from the handle.', ""Easy to use with lots of YouTube videos available for reference. If you're in the market for a quality coffee maker that won't left you broke, this is it."", ""Great machine.  Brews a great espresso once you have it dialed in.  That takes some time, but once you do. It's clear sailing. "", 'This is an espresso machine far better than any other ones I owned over the years. I really recommend it to anyone who loves espresso. The only downside is that the machine is a little bit weak/slow in making milk froth. Other than that a perfect machine in every respect.', ""There is a learning curve with espresso, grounds must be just the right size and tamping just enough pressure and etc.  The Breville allows you to adjust a lot to the variables.  So what I'm saying it still tweaking to get the best.""]","New: A brand-new, unused, unopened, undamaged item in its original packaging (where packaging is applicable).

Hamilton Beach Espresso Maker Model 40715, , ,"[""The 1500 millibar Italian made pump makes it comparable to more expensive machines.The filters can be separated and cleaned inside.  Important feature that's not available in many other, more expensive, espresso makers.  Therefore this cheaper one is far more durable!"", ""Finally tonight I'm giving up as the temperature is still luke warm and it dumps grounds into the cup.Had 3 different guests now review the instructions with me in case I am missing something.Decided it's not worth dealing with and likely doesn't work.No one was even interested in trying to figure it out. Should be straight forward.Don't see how we are missing anything."", 'This is the second identical Hamilton Beach Espresso machine that I have owned. The last one lasted for about three years. It was used every day for three years and gave very good service. The new machine will likely hold up like the old machine and I was very satisfied with the durability of the old machine. The new machine brews up great espresso and the frother  works well. ', 'Awesome machine. My B&amp;D died within 6 months, this one seems to keep going. The15 bar pressure makes a better product than some of the other lower end machines. ', 'Surprisingly this is a super machine!  If you follow the directions, its very simple to use also.Steaming milk is quick and even allows for you to froth it two different ways.Pulling shots is easy, although finding the right grind takes some work.Cleaning the wand is easy, the portafilter basket a little more difficult.  I have not tried backflushing the gruppo to clean it, but wipes up fairly clean with just a wet rag.  (Gruppo, the part attached to the machine that the water comes through into the portafilter.  It will have a big screw in the center with a screen similar to the portafilter.)', 'I can hardly express just how thrilled I am with this machine.  I am a bonafide espresso snob... with my heretofore favorite machine being the Rancilio Silvia ($700), but when my Silvia needed repair, I looked for a cheaper used machine for the mean time. I went through a mid-range DeLonghi (retail $199) and hated everything about it. Cheap, light plastic, poor design, and the thing got clogged every week requiring TEDIOUS cleaning of every little hole with a straight pin! We called it the ""Easy Back Oven of espresso machines,"" A cheap TOY.Then I won this Hamilton Beach machine on ebay for a not-even-serious low bid and was THRILLED with everything about it (for the price)! It makes the best crema we have EVER had (even compared to the Silvia), it is just smartly designed, it makes great solid foamed milk quickly, and the thing only retails for $129!! Get one used on ebay for a whole lot less.Finally, I can confidently recommend something to my friends who ask me about an entry-level espresso machine that doesn\'t cost $700. This thing is GREAT. Absolutely the best value I have ever seen for the price. The only thing that remains to be seen is how long it lasts.', 'It is the second one we bought on EBAY and works well, producing lots of crema. We hope to find some spare parts, but so far have not.', 'Have used several espresso machines in my life. This has been the best machine I have purchased for the money.', 'Easy to use and clean. Very efficient machine.']","New: A brand-new, unused, unopened, undamaged item in its original packaging (where packaging is applicable).

Gaggia Brera Super Automatic Espresso Machine in Black. Pannarello Wand Froth...,775.16,30-day returns,"['I’ve owned my Gaggia Brera for over a year &amp; a half, I’ve never had a single issue with it. It has brewed consistent espresso every time. I love the different options (strength, cup size, ground coarseness) it allows you to get your espresso exactly how you like it. I love the easiness of the cleaning. I recently bought a Jura &amp; my Gaggia is just as good as my Jura. I’m questioning why I purchased a new one. My only complaint is the size of the water tank, I wish it was larger. But on the plus side, it’s a smaller machine that doesn’t take up a lot of room on your counter. I would repurchase in a heartbeat. Don’t think that because the Brera is cheaper than most every other super automatic, that it can’t compare in quality. It is just as good if not better than several other more expensive machines of its kind that I have used.', ""I have used several super automatic espresso machines.   This was the first one that I purchased myself, based entirely off of the ratings, but no firsthand experience.  At first I was a bit skeptical upon receiving it, likely because of how unfamiliar I was with it.  After about 3 weeks of use I am very impressed.  The machine makes a great espresso shot, and the milk frother is quite good in comparison to the other machines I have tried.  My only two complaints, which i don't find to be a huge deal, are the size of the water, and grind reservoirs.  You pretty much have to fill/empty after each couple of drinks.  Not a huge deal because they are easy to access, and the machine is incredibly easy to clean.Very satisfied so far, lets hope it lasts a couple of years."", 'Excellent product and service! Very helpful tips on how to use the brewer and the brewer looked almost new when it arrived. Have used it every day the last 3 months and no issues. Thank you!', ""We have a small kitchen and it was important to find something that will fit the right size. We're using this machine for a week and so far so good. I have much more expensive coffee maker at work (worth $3500) and there is no difference in espresso quality. If it would last for long enough I would consider it as a great buy.NOTE: this machine is not recommending oily dark coffee beans (dark roast). They say it might break the grinder. That's the only warning I would give to others who might read this review. E.g. if you buy this machine, use non-oily (light roast) beans."", 'This machine is a very good and easy to use and brew espresso and cappuccino.  I have used this for about 2 months now and have no issues with it.  Espresso is just as good as the coffee shops for a fraction of the price and its at the convenience of your own home.  Do not hesitate to purchase this machine you will be happy with the results.', 'This coffee maker is so easy to use and makes a fantastic cuppa coffee. The instructions are easy to use. In the YouTube videos of the coffee maker you’ll learn a lot more tricks watching the YouTube videos', 'Excellent I had this machine before. I do go through a machine (different ones) about every 5 years or so? I use it all the time. I have tried to use many other coffee makers, instant, old fashion percolators, press, everything. I have to say there is nothing like a super automatic coffee maker.', 'I got this for Christmas.

Sunbeam EM5000K Café Barista Semi-Automatic Coffee Machine,275.0, ,"['This is an excellent product, easy to use, never had any problems with Sunbeam products, so I did not expect any with this machine. The Latte setting was a bonus. Easy self cleaning. 100% satisfied.', ""So 2-1/2yrs of use, at least 2 cups of coffee per day sometimes more if we had guests, never descaled or serviced, just used. Never missed a beat. Sadly the pump protested this amount of use (really !? LOL) and began a slow demise. So before it stopped pumping completely we've bought another one from Myer Ebay. Back to having full strength coffees with only one press of the button. Here's to another 2-1/2 years of glorious coffee from The Coffee Bean Shop Adelaide Central Markets (gratuitous plug for great coffee beans) and beyond.I just hope they are still making this machine in 2 years time.Enjoy :D"", 'This was my first manual coffee machine purchase. So I had zero experience, but after a few goes and watching a few videos online... it’s pretty easy to use !A lot of people complain the milk isn’t hot enough... for me the temperature is perfect, but for those who need a piping hot coffee you can always put the milk in the microwave before hand. I recommend getting a coffee grinder also, that way the beans are extra fresh.I haven’t mastered the perfect cappuccino or latte yet, but it’s delicious every time ! The only downside I can think of, there’s a lot of things to do, like for cleaning a pod machine you just run it again and a quick wipe and it’s all done. But this machine you have to clean everything and it can be quite time consuming. Other than that, great purchase !!!', 'I am so impressed with this coffee machine! I was nearly put off by some of the reviews but I’m so glad I ordered it anyway. It is such great value for money and the coffees are beautiful! It is extremely easy to use. I don’t have any issues with the temperature, but I do ensure the froth is all the way down, as it is quite frothy! I’ve worked out that a small latte and an extra shot of coffee is perfect for me! If you’re contemplating buying this machine, I highly recommend it! ', 'Makes great coffee. Good machine, simple to work, would be better with an inbuilt grinder.', 'Excellent product. It makes the coffee how you tell it you like coffee latte or cappuccino. No fuss with getting the coffee machine. Is a substantial addition to my kitchen. I love it.', 'I love the product,very easy to use', ""It took me a while to purchase this, but I finally could not resist the great price that was offered.  I am very glad that I did as it works extremely well and does exactly what it says it should do!  For the price and for coffee lovers it's well worth the buy for its looks, takes only a small space up on the bench (so that's a bonus) and everything is easy to do to get the coffee the way you like it!  I am not a big coffee user, but it's just as good a coffee as a cafe with a minimum of the cost.  It will pay for itself in a short time if you/your family love to drink coffee!"", 'punches well above its appearance and size perfect for two people features, ease of opperation so good,  wife happy makes for good life.', 'Bought in a hurry to replace a broken machine. ...

Electric Espresso Coffee Maker 3-6-Cup Capacity Machine Black Stainless Steel ,83.94,30-day returns,"['Since I was a kid. My mother would prepare moka on the stove using the same old moka coffee maker that are so popular. Years pass, I move to my own apartment and take with me some of the old moka stove only coffee makers and continue to enjoy a good cup once in a while. In one ocassion I was left with no Propane gas so I had to use electric appliances for cooking but alas, no moka for those sad days. That is when I began looking for an electric version and I found this one from DeLonghi. A good design, it keeps the classic design with some additions, now you put the moka in a plate with an on/off switch which starts the process. No difference in flavor or quality and a good addition for those who prefer electricity to heating on the stove. I should  mention it is safer also since it only keeps running for 30 minutes unattended and then it switches off by itself, which I do not think you can do on a gas stove.', ""I've used stovetop Moka pots in the past, and they all work about the same, but I love the fact that the Alicia frees me from having to use the stove for my coffee!  It's a sturdy little pot that brews a GREAT cup of coffee!  The filter basket has an insert so you can brew 3 cups instead of 6 if you wish, which is great for me since I'm the only coffee drinker in my house!  The pot is pretty easy to clean with just water, but make sure you let the prts dry completely before reassembly or you may get some corrosion start in the boiler!"", ""This is my third one in 15 years. I would say one every 7 &amp; 1/2 years is excellent life expectancy. I love this product or I wouldn't continually keep buying it."", 'Great travel coffee maker! Easy, well written instructions. Not too hard to clean either! Looking to get another to keep at work.', 'I discovered this machine about 15 years ago. I think they may have been discontinued so I am buying another while I can. Just brilliant. Mine has traveled the world with me and is the first thing I pack. The best way to make coffee and does it with an electric power source. The standard Italian version of this type of machine is heated on an electric stove top or a gas burner - sources that aren\'t always available. I usually manage to find a power source somewhere. Even if I\'m camping in a non-powered campsite the toilet/shower block will always have a power point. I have even been known to sneak it into McDonalds in a shopping bag. Sit down the back, plug it in, buy a muffin and wait for that familiar percolating sound. The ""brew quickly"" comment depends on the voltage of the country. The 100v power source in Japan can make it a bit slow. Worth the wait though.', ""My world traveling sister brought her Alicia when she visited made lattes for us. It is simple and easy to use. While it doesn't have a steamer, you can microwave and whip milk for great lattes. Have had minor problems with leaking where the top screws on, but I think it is user error more than design. Great way to have convenient espresso to go."", ""This coffeemaker is everything I expected. Is fast and makes great coffee. Is a 6 cup so is a little big, but I can invite co-workers for coffee without feeling guilty.It takes a little getting use to the fact that the bottom part cannot be submerged in water, but I got it. Also, the top part handle is plastic, and needs to be aware that you can not tighten the pieces using the handle, 'cause it could break. I am planning to take it to future trips or vacation, so I can have the best espresso coffee, without leaving the room!!!"", 'It takes about 3-4 mins to brew and is easy to clean. Make sure to make about 3 batches of coffee first to get rid of the plastic taste of the initial first uses.', ""I've owned one of the these for years already and love the product.  It is east to use and clean, and makes excellent espresso coffee in under 5 minutes.works everywhere, like hotel room and camping, if you are without a range but with electricity."", 'Brews coffee well, measures take sometime to learn and the keep warm function is really cool, in total a great product.']","New: A brand-new, unused, unopened, undamaged item in its original packaging (where packaging is applicable).

The left over espresso in the port a filter is a little watery so it is not easy to dump the spent grounds. However, the espresso brews a nice tasting shot with good creama. I bought a machine to give to a friend because it is easy to use and makes a good drink.', 'I purchased this machine lightly used but “fully functional”. Unfortunately, it is not fully functional. Espresso brewing was as satisfactory as you’re going to get with a machine like this. The machine and parts are easy to use and clean. However, it is recommended to use 20-22g coffee for the 2 cup basket. I found this was too much and could not even secure the portafilter in the group head with that amount of grounds tamped in. I found that 15-16g was more appropriate. The steam function did not work on my machine. It takes several minutes to begin steaming and by then the shot is cold. The steam just spits and sputters out and does not create a whirlpool motion in the milk. The steam shuts off before the milk is textured or warmed. I am very disappointed in the steam function on this machine. I don’t know if these problems are due to a used machine, but despite this, I cannot recommend this machine. ', ""I have little experience with espresso machines, but what I can say it works as it should.  Espresso making takes practice.  One issue I am having is the steam switch.  I keep accidentally flipping it to brew an espresso instead of in the ready position. This causes me to double brew.  Maybe it's my fault, but it keeps happening.  Good machine overall though."", 'This is a serious home coffee machine for the real coffee lover. I had a cheap machine before this which did me proud for a few years but eventually packed up. I decided it was worth spending a bit to replace it and I am not disappointed with this Calphalon.It is worth reading the instructions as it’s easy to get things a little off and ruin your coffee but once you’ve got the knack of quantity, press, cleaning and suchlike this machine works like a dream and makes a super rich cuppa. The steamer is very powerful and requires almost no maintenance which I like as my old one required frequent disassembly. ', 'I had my eyes on a more expensive model but found that this is an extremely well-made and very efficient machine. It heats up quickly and properly easily making the perfect espresso. And the price was less than half the price of the Breville infuser which is a great machine also', 'This espresso maker is great! It is super easy to use and makes great espresso drinks. The steamer is a favorite in our home for hot chocolate. My wife uses the hot water fu croon for making tea. I highly recommend this espresso maker. ', ""We bought this as an open box item after a friend raved about it. So far so good. Works well, I would like it to be a little easier to clean, but I can't say that it's any worse than other espresso machines. The steam wand is good. Can't say anything about durability, but it seems to be fairly sturdy"", ""I bought this item last week and over all I'm fair satisfied with it, machine heat is fast, quality of espresso is fair and quality of steam milk is poor doesn't make any foam, with this machine can be made espresso and maciato for latte and Capuchino it's not enough foam"", 'The machine is fairly easy to use, especially for a beginner.', 'Easy to follow instruction on how to use, and performs very well.']","New: A brand-new, unused, unopened, undamaged item in its original packaging (where packaging is applicable).
