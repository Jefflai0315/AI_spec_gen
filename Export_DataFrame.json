The dosage on the back of the soap container is already too much. Soap contains fat to prevent it from solidifying. This fat will eat holes in the rubber seal and eventually in the bearing. Use less soap, and once a month clean the machine. Dont buy expensive shit to clean it. Just wash at a high temperature without any clothes in it. If the machine is older and not used to the high temperature, use one lower. You could also put some vinegar in it (about a cup). Make sure to put the vinegar in a plastic bowl or somethin, not just loose in the machine. Every machine starts with pumping and it will be gone before used if you just poor it in the machine. \n\nI say this because i see the brown fat that indicates overdosing already. This can also make a shitty smell over time and even get stains in the clothes. However, going on like this will be fatal for the machine.
