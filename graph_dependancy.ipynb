Only issue compared to equivalent branded Coonara's I've used is the smoke always that enters the house when topping the wood up - it's almost as if the front overhang is too short.

Secondly they have very poor air draw, even with the vent open they still go out.

First, it takes longer to heat the firebrick and establish a proper bed of coals, during this time it does not burn efficiently and puts more smoke up the flue, because its not hot enough to ignite ...\",\n",

       "  'dangerous attempt at your own risk connect everything a though you are about to weld before powering up the welder turn off the circuit breaker for top outlet leave it off turn on the power switch to the welder absolutely nothing will happen carefully remove the plug from the top outlet and check the voltage across the hot male connector and any ground do not touch the prong on the plug you will find 120 v and the panel will provide up to 20 amp breaker rating thru the welder which is more than 1000 time the amount necessary to stop your heart if the hot prong touch a ground conductor thousand of amp will flow in the instance of time necessary for the breaker to trip a hot prong male should never be allowed to exist for obvious reason not during normal use or in the event of a failure outlet are female so there is no exposed conductor with high voltage current this scenario demonstrates the hazard when the two breaker are not physically connected together well mostly even if no breaker is tripped a long a everything is connected and the welder is on not necessary to be welding the same hazardous situation exists if either 120 v plug is accidentally pulled from the outlet when that lug touch a ground it will vaporize and splatter molten brass in all direction this will almost certainly fry the welder a a static inverter is not near a forgiving a a big old transformer or the wire wound dc generator used in the old aircraft welder you mentioned that you are aware that it would be a bad idea to pull either plug from the 120 volt outlet with the welder on in use besides the issue describe above you would risk causing a large arc which can injure you or someone else and or the equipment although arcing is still a real issue if it were absolutely necessary to pull a plug in a critical situation i would pull both at the exact same time using just one hand the other hand in your pocket and isolated from any ground all very hard to do in a welding environment arcing may be slightly reduced because you are breaking two connection point simultaneously advantage when two breaker trip at the same time and the risk of having a live male plug would be eliminated people may argue that the welder will offer resistance and or reactance and will not pas current during this test and the actual amount of current that will pas is negligible not true it will be more than enough to kill someone another serious issue with this arrangement is ground current no it is not because you chose to use the ground wire connection and not the neutral though not legal essentially it is correctly wired there is absolutely no use for neutral in this circuit back to ground current and other hazardous voltage because current flow in just one direction from the panel to point of use in each of the 120 v outlet there is no canceling magnetic induction this normally neutralizes the voltage induced in the grounding conductor other thing like a floating ground can occur a well but mentioned here only for completeness further since a considerable amount of current will be flowing it will induce voltage in the neutral a well this can cause damage to other device that you mentioned are connected to the original outlet further if you have a water pipe or grounding rod close to your garage you can prove this a well here is how set up a you would to weld breaker on everything connected and ready to weld connect a volt meter from ground on any one of the 3 metal electrical box in use top bottom or 240 v outlet box it doe not matter just need a good circuit ground connect the other meter lead to a water pipe ground rod ground point for cable tv etc whatever is close to the garage if nothing is close find a safe place to drive a not rusty long spike or rebar into the soil a few foot or more and connect to it strike a low current arc and read the meter you will likely find 60 v if you touch your grounded box or welder and another ground even the concrete floor you will get a decent tingle or a maybe serious shock one other test worth doing is checking the voltage across neutral and ground at any of the outlet that share either of the 2 circuit breaker in question you will likely see similar voltage when there is considerable current draw at the 240 volt outlet i have had the occasion to use the same type of welder and i believe the 50 amp plug and cord is overkill however other comment suggest the total amount of current available to your welder with your split setup is 40 amp absolutely not true although you can draw twice the power from a 240 v 20 amp circuit v 120 volt power in watt 240 volt x 20 amp 480 watt you can not draw more than 20 amp through either of the 2 breaker in this circuit having an additional 20 amp breaker in the circuit doe not facilitate an additional 20 amp in this arrangement the 2 breaker are in series and what flow through one must flow through the other and 20 amp is the limit period in fact if you had 240 480 volt service exists outside the u and in some industrial commercial application here you would need just one breaker to run a 240 volt device further if that circuit had 12 gauge wire and the appropriate 20 amp breaker it could provide the exact same amount of current that your is doe and consequently the same amount of power it seems you have some idea what you are doing and for a quick and dirty in a pinch i would use the same setup however i would physically unplug all other device in the house garage that share either of the 2 breaker second i would make sure that i do not set up a ground loop and put myself or someone else in the middle of it this will be very hard to ensure when welding understand chance are you will not damage the welder but it is possible also although the welder should have adequate filtering to prevent noise and high voltage spike the hi frequency switching circuit in the welder can have a significan not impact on device in your home and or your neighbor some of the import have minimal filtering this make a good non noisy ground essential if you have a secondary ground in the garage water pipe a ground rod that penetrates 6 8 foot into the ground i would ground the 240 v 50 amp receptacle to it not the most ideal arrangement but with your panel being so far away it better than nothing first check for ground voltage a described above and verify it drop to a negligible voltage once an additional ground is installed there will likely still be ground current that are le than desirable but safer a long a the ground connection remains undisturbed during use btw a small 240 volt load of 4 5 amp other than the welder may make it easier to determine how much voltage and current on the ground and neutral finally i highly recommend having the correct wiring installed it will protect you and everything else mentioned much better than the quick and dirty sorry to be so long winded but there is way more going on here than meet the eye i have worked installing and troubleshooting power system in very large computer room and you would be surprised how a little ground current leakage noise can play havoc with equipment i know this is an old video but i finally got around to seen the first star war good luck',\n",

       "  'dangerous attempt at your own risk connect everything a though you are about to weld before powering up the welder turn off the circuit breaker for top outlet leave it off turn on the power switch to the welder absolutely nothing will happen carefully remove the plug from the top outlet and check the voltage across the hot male connector and any ground do not touch the prong on the plug you will find 120 v and the panel will provide up to 20 amp breaker rating thru the welder which is more than 1000 time the amount necessary to stop your heart if the hot prong touch a ground conductor thousand of amp will flow in the instance of time necessary for the breaker to trip a hot prong male should never be allowed to exist for obvious reason not during normal use or in the event of a failure outlet are female so there is no exposed conductor with high voltage current this scenario demonstrates the hazard when the two breaker are not physically connected together well mostly even if no breaker is tripped a long a everything is connected and the welder is on not necessary to be welding the same hazardous situation exists if either 120 v plug is accidentally pulled from the outlet when that lug touch a ground it will vaporize and splatter molten brass in all direction this will almost certainly fry the welder a a static inverter is not near a forgiving a a big old transformer or the wire wound dc generator used in the old aircraft welder you mentioned that you are aware that it would be a bad idea to pull either plug from the 120 volt outlet with the welder on in use besides the issue describe above you would risk causing a large arc which can injure you or someone else and or the equipment although arcing is still a real issue if it were absolutely necessary to pull a plug in a critical situation i would pull both at the exact same time using just one hand the other hand in your pocket and isolated from any ground all very hard to do in a welding environment arcing may be slightly reduced because you are breaking two connection point simultaneously advantage when two breaker trip at the same time and the risk of having a live male plug would be eliminated people may argue that the welder will offer resistance and or reactance and will not pas current during this test and the actual amount of current that will pas is negligible not true it will be more than enough to kill someone another serious issue with this arrangement is ground current no it is not because you chose to use the ground wire connection and not the neutral though not legal essentially it is correctly wired there is absolutely no use for neutral in this circuit back to ground current and other hazardous voltage because current flow in just one direction from the panel to point of use in each of the 120 v outlet there is no canceling magnetic induction this normally neutralizes the voltage induced in the grounding conductor other thing like a floating ground can occur a well but mentioned here only for completeness further since a considerable amount of current will be flowing it will induce voltage in the neutral a well this can cause damage to other device that you mentioned are connected to the original outlet further if you have a water pipe or grounding rod close to your garage you can prove this a well here is how set up a you would to weld breaker on everything connected and ready to weld connect a volt meter from ground on any one of the 3 metal electrical box in use top bottom or 240 v outlet box it doe not matter just need a good circuit ground connect the other meter lead to a water pipe ground rod ground point for cable tv etc whatever is close to the garage if nothing is close find a safe place to drive a not rusty long spike or rebar into the soil a few foot or more and connect to it strike a low current arc and read the meter you will likely find 60 v if you touch your grounded box or welder and another ground even the concrete floor you will get a decent tingle or a maybe serious shock one other test worth doing is checking the voltage across neutral and ground at any of the outlet that share either of the 2 circuit breaker in question you will likely see similar voltage when there is considerable current draw at the 240 volt outlet i have had the occasion to use the same type of welder and i believe the 50 amp plug and cord is overkill however other comment suggest the total amount of current available to your welder with your split setup is 40 amp absolutely not true although you can draw twice the power from a 240 v 20 amp circuit v 120 volt power in watt 240 volt x 20 amp 480 watt you can not draw more than 20 amp through either of the 2 breaker in this circuit having an additional 20 amp breaker in the circuit doe not facilitate an additional 20 amp in this arrangement the 2 breaker are in series and what flow through one must flow through the other and 20 amp is the limit period in fact if you had 240 480 volt service exists outside the u and in some industrial commercial application here you would need just one breaker to run a 240 volt device further if that circuit had 12 gauge wire and the appropriate 20 amp breaker it could provide the exact same amount of current that your is doe and consequently the same amount of power it seems you have some idea what you are doing and for a quick and dirty in a pinch i would use the same setup however i would physically unplug all other device in the house garage that share either of the 2 breaker second i would make sure that i do not set up a ground loop and put myself or someone else in the middle of it this will be very hard to ensure when welding understand chance are you will not damage the welder but it is possible also although the welder should have adequate filtering to prevent noise and high voltage spike the hi frequency switching circuit in the welder can have a significan not impact on device in your home and or your neighbor some of the import have minimal filtering this make a good non noisy ground essential if you have a secondary ground in the garage water pipe a ground rod that penetrates 6 8 foot into the ground i would ground the 240 v 50 amp receptacle to it not the most ideal arrangement but with your panel being so far away it better than nothing first check for ground voltage a described above and verify it drop to a negligible voltage once an additional ground is installed there will likely still be ground current that are le than desirable but safer a long a the ground connection remains undisturbed during use btw a small 240 volt load of 4 5 amp other than the welder may make it easier to determine how much voltage and current on the ground and neutral finally i highly recommend having the correct wiring installed it will protect you and everything else mentioned much better than the quick and dirty sorry to be so long winded but there is way more going on here than meet the eye i have worked installing and troubleshooting power system in very large computer room and you would be surprised how a little ground current leakage noise can play havoc with equipment i know this is an old video but i finally got around to seen the first star war good luck',\n",
       "  'just curious if you wired the garage and purposely put 2 outlet in one on top of the other in the garage and i believe you said it wa a similar situation outside in another location rather than turning 110 into 220 why would not you run 6 or 8 gauge romex and a double 40 circuit then make an adapter to turn the 220 info say 2 duplex outlet one off of each leg of the 220 for my christmas light i got tired of having to run extension cord from the front porch plug the back porch plug the shed and the outlet directly on my power pole under the meter and then having to get 6 timer that were always a minute or two off from one another making my elaborate display look like somebody with no self respect and pride in their work threw it up without proper testing to ensure that all the light were in working order so i installed a double 60a welder range outlet on the back of my house under the deck and with a dryer cord powered a 120a breaker box that i had mounted to a piece of plywood that wa attached to a stand made out of 4x4 is from the panel i had 5 piece of 12 2 that were 100 120 foot long hooked up to 20a breaker in the box and the other end wa a duplex outlet with 2 outlet for a total of 4 plug these where stretched out to various point in the yard and extension cord went from them to the various tree fence fixture and ornament in one area or another then below the box on the plywood where my seasonal panel wa mounted i had 7 duplex outlet and they were each on their own breaker which filled up the 12 slot box i wa using the various extension cord from light nativity flood window door roof and the perimeter fence near the house all of filled the plug below the seasonal box so i only have to go to the basement and throw the one 220 breaker and it kill the entire christmas light display and i do not get cold turning it off but this year i think i might install a commercial timer for the seasonal panel and not worry about turning it off at 1 am every night but with all my boring detail when you wired the garage would not it have been easier to run a heavy feeder and install a sub panel in the garage or a 220 outlet rather than creating a device that in the event of fire or something else disastrous might present you with a huge issue of liability with your insurance company',\n",

       "  'i have been hunting deer for 42 year now and never worried about the cold weather when i wa younger mostly because pop up portable blind and portable heater like these were not available back then but my youngest daughter started hunting with me 6 year ago and after watching her brave a particularly cold opening day her first year i decided there had to be a better setup so she could enjoy going with me and i could insure i would get to continue to enjoy spending such moment with her so i bought my first ground blind and my first mr heater little buddy heater and closing weekend of rifle season wa soooooo much more enjoyable having a heat source to warm our foot made all the difference in the world being able to sit beside my daughter and just watch her scan our surroundings for her first deer and did she take a beauty after realizing how great the difference in the experience having shelter and heat made i broke down and bought blind for my dad nephew and great friend who owns the property where we hunt and then decided everyone should be able to stay warm and enjoy their time in the field a well so i retired my little buddy heater and bought three of the buddy heater and one of the heater cooker model and stocked each blind with a heater the difference between the little buddy and the bigger buddy model is very noticeably different running the bigger buddy heater warmed up a two person ground blind sufficiently enough to allow u to take off our coat even with several window open and sit comfortably without creating undue noise or alert to the deer a we watched many feed and browse around in the field in front of u hunting went from a cold and trying event to a greatly enjoyed experience spending time with my daughter my dad my nephew and friend i have always said a bad day hunting or fishing is better than a good day working anytime but having mr heater buddy heater warming our ground blind ha made such a difference in our time spent together so much more enjoyable that now my oldest daughter is joining in and that alone made any expense paid for the equipment one of my best investment funny story my dad wa using the heater i put in the blind he wa using and after spending the morning hunting we all went to breakfast and i asked him how well he liked having heat and his reply wa great for about 20 minute and then the damned thing quit and would not re light i asked him if he had opened any window and he said no it wa not light yet so i wa just enjoying staying warm until the heater went out i started laughing and he wa taken aback by my reaction and asked why i wa laughing had i played a joke and given him the junk heater i said no and told him he should be thankful mr heater saved his life not knowing what i wa referring to he had a puzzled look on his face so i told him that the heater ha a low oxygen sensor built into it and because he had the window closed up fresh air could not circulate through the blind and the heater shut off before he could pas out from carbon monoxide poisoning the look on his face wa priceless all he could say wa glad someone wa looking out for him after breakfast and getting some chore done we all went back to our blind and my dad made sure he opened some window and lit the heater and spent the rest of the day happy and warm moral of the story the safety feature built into mr heater heater work excellent design quality built and smart safety feature all make mr heater heater great product you can trust and that make experience during cold weather so much more enjoyable and if having one get a friend or family member to join in the fun that is money well spent not to mention having the added insurance of staying warm at home should the power go out for an extended period of time during cold weather so that is my experience with mr heater heater and i can and do highly recommend to anyone needing and looking for a quality and dependable portable small heater get one you will be glad you did',\n",

       "  'your contraption will mostly work and will get you by doing what you intend to do with it but juan carlos valdez earlier comment had the best idea for supplying 240 vac to your two location at 20 amp with no new wiring needed and no contraption considering that you do not care about the code in your video you mentioned that if you unplugged one plug from it is outlet you could not get shocked from the exposed plug prong because nothing in your 240 vac outlet box is connected from the plugged in prong to the exposed prong true but zoom out a little farther and think about the load if it is still turned on or any other path through it exists then you get 120 vac potential from the exposed hot prong to the ground prong of the unplugged plug fuzzylon also mentioned this in an earlier comment 240 vac potential would also exist between the exposed hot prong of the removed plug and the corresponding slot in the outlet it came from but you would be hard pressed to get yourself shocked that way i assume that you assumed the circuit would be broken by the load being turned off the center tap of the pole transformer is grounded with 120 vac on either side of that grounded center 180 degree out of phase any difference in amp leaving one end of that transformer than returning through the other end think the effect of your garage lighting on only one leg must return through the grounded center tap this is the imbalance other commenters are talking about the lighting doe have an actual copper connection to this center tap though through the white conductor so should not cause it is current to flow through ground the green or bare conductor to get there i do not think they necessarily thought about that beside your use of 15 amp extension cord wiring i noticed you were only using 15 amp outlet cwbywy also noted this in an earlier post lot of very weak link in this setup again if you are going to ignore code at least juan carlos valdez had a more elegant solution that us your existing wiring but hey you sure did get a lot of people thinking about their electrical theory with your video',\n",

       "  'i have been hunting deer for 42 year now and never worried about the cold weather when i wa younger mostly because pop up portable blind and portable heater like these were not available back then but my youngest daughter started hunting with me 6 year ago and after watching her brave a particularly cold opening day her first year i decided there had to be a better setup so she could enjoy going with me and i could insure i would get to continue to enjoy spending such moment with her so i bought my first ground blind and my first mr heater little buddy heater and closing weekend of rifle season wa soooooo much more enjoyable having a heat source to warm our foot made all the difference in the world being able to sit beside my daughter and just watch her scan our surroundings for her first deer and did she take a beauty after realizing how great the difference in the experience having shelter and heat made i broke down and bought blind for my dad nephew and great friend who owns the property where we hunt and then decided everyone should be able to stay warm and enjoy their time in the field a well so i retired my little buddy heater and bought three of the buddy heater and one of the heater cooker model and stocked each blind with a heater the difference between the little buddy and the bigger buddy model is very noticeably different running the bigger buddy heater warmed up a two person ground blind sufficiently enough to allow u to take off our coat even with several window open and sit comfortably without creating undue noise or alert to the deer a we watched many feed and browse around in the field in front of u hunting went from a cold and trying event to a greatly enjoyed experience spending time with my daughter my dad my nephew and friend i have always said a bad day hunting or fishing is better than a good day working anytime but having mr heater buddy heater warming our ground blind ha made such a difference in our time spent together so much more enjoyable that now my oldest daughter is joining in and that alone made any expense paid for the equipment one of my best investment funny story my dad wa using the heater i put in the blind he wa using and after spending the morning hunting we all went to breakfast and i asked him how well he liked having heat and his reply wa great for about 20 minute and then the damned thing quit and would not re light i asked him if he had opened any window and he said no it wa not light yet so i wa just enjoying staying warm until the heater went out i started laughing and he wa taken aback by my reaction and asked why i wa laughing had i played a joke and given him the junk heater i said no and told him he should be thankful mr heater saved his life not knowing what i wa referring to he had a puzzled look on his face so i told him that the heater ha a low oxygen sensor built into it and because he had the window closed up fresh air could not circulate through the blind and the heater shut off before he could pas out from carbon monoxide poisoning the look on his face wa priceless all he could say wa glad someone wa looking out for him after breakfast and getting some chore done we all went back to our blind and my dad made sure he opened some window and lit the heater and spent the rest of the day happy and warm moral of the story the safety feature built into mr heater heater work excellent design quality built and smart safety feature all make mr heater heater great product you can trust and that make experience during cold weather so much more enjoyable and if having one get a friend or family member to join in the fun that is money well spent not to mention having the added insurance of staying warm at home should the power go out for an extended period of time during cold weather so that is my experience with mr heater heater and i can and do highly recommend to anyone needing and looking for a quality and dependable portable small heater get one you will be glad you did',\n",

in a hurry if you needed to easier to flip a breaker than to unplug something or 2 somethings in your case just my opinion my garage did not have 220 either it only ha one 110v line you are lucky you have 2 separate circuit so my solution wa to essentially make a very heavy duty 220 volt extension cord i used 6 gauge wire and i plug it into my dryer outlet in my house since we do not have a dryer the circuit wa unused so it worked out well i can now run my 220 volt equipment with no problem my mill w phase convertor and air compressor run on 220v and my hobart welder run on 110v i can easily run my mill and compressor together the only annoyance is rolling out this cord it is not heavy but stiff and bulky a you can imagine eventually i will bury the line and run it to the breaker box properly but crawling under the house is not exactly something i am looking forward to thanks for sharing the video p i am not a professional electrician by any mean so take my advice a you will those
